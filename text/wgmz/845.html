[book_title]船的到来
当代的曙光，被选而被爱戴的亚墨斯达法，在阿法利斯城中等候了十二年，等他的船到来，好载他归回他生长的岛上去。
在第十二年绮露收获之月的第七天，他出城登上山顶，向海凝望；他看见了他的船在烟雾中驶来。
他的心门砉然地开了，他的喜乐在海面飞翔。他合上眼，在灵魂的严静中祷告。
但当他上山的时候，忽然一阵悲哀袭来。他心里想：我怎能这般宁静地走去而没有些悲哀？不，我要精神上不受创伤地离此城郭。
在这城围里，我度过了悠久的痛苦的日月和孤寂的深夜；谁能撇下这痛苦与孤寂没有一些悼惜？
在这街市上我曾撒下过多的零碎的精神，在这山中也有过多的赤裸着行走的我所爱怜的孩子，离开他们，我不能不觉得负担与痛心。
这不是今日我脱弃了一件衣裳，乃是我用自己的手撕下了自己的一块皮肤。
也不是我遗弃了一种思想，乃是遗弃了一个用饥和渴做成的甜蜜的心。
然而我不能再迟留了。
那召唤万物来归的大海，也在召唤我，我必须登舟了。
因为，若是停留下来，我的归思，在夜间虽仍灼热奋发，渐渐地却要冰冷变石了。
我若能把这里的一切都带了去，何等的快乐呵，但是我又怎能呢？
声音不能把付给他翅翼的舌头和嘴唇带走。他自己必须寻求“以太”。
鹰鸟也必须撇下窝巢，独自地飞过太阳。
现在他走到山脚，又转面向海，他看见他的船徐徐地驶入湾口，那些在船头的舟子，正是他的故乡人。
于是他的精魂向着他们呼唤，说：
弄潮者，我的老母的孩儿，
有多少次你们在我的梦中浮泛。现在你们在我的更深的梦中，也就是我苏醒的时候驶来了。
我已准备好要去了，我的热望和帆篷一同扯满，等着风来。
我只要在这静止的空气中再呼吸一口气，我只要再向后抛掷热爱的一瞥，
那时我要站在你们中间，一个航海者群中的航海者。
还有你，这无边的大海，无眠的慈母，只有你是江河和溪水的宁静与自由。
这溪流还有一次转折，一次林中的潺缓，
然后我要到你这里来，无量的涓滴归向这无量的海洋。
当他行走的时候，他看见从远处有许多男女离开田园，急速地赶到城边来。
他听见他们叫着他的名字，在阡陌中彼此呼唤，报告他的船来临。他对自己说：
别离的日子能成为聚会的日子么？
我的薄暮实在可算是我的黎明么？
那些放下了耕田的犁耙，停止了榨酒的轮子的人们，我将给他们什么呢？
我的心能成为一棵累累结实的树，可以采撷了分给他们么？我的愿望能奔流如泉水，可以倾满他们的杯么？
我是一个全能者的手可能弹奏的琴，或是一管全能者可以吹弄的笛么？
我是一个寂静的寻求者。在寂静中，我发现了什么宝藏，可以放心地布施呢？
倘若这是我收获的日子，那么，在何时何地我曾撒下了种子呢？
倘若这确是我举起明灯的时候，那么，灯内的火焰，不是我点上的。
我将空虚黑暗地举起我的灯，
守夜的人将要添上油，也点上火。
这些是他口中说出的，还有许多没有说出的存在心头。因为他说不出自己心中更深的秘密。
他进城的时候，众人都来迎接，齐声地向他呼唤。
城中的长老走上前来说：
你不要离开我们。
在我们的朦胧里，你是正午的潮者，你青春的气度，给我们以梦想。
你在我们中间不是一个异乡人，也不是一个客人，乃是我们的儿子和亲挚的爱者。不要使我们的眼睛因渴望你的脸面而酸痛。
一班道人和女冠对他说：
不要让海波在这时把我们分开，使你在我们中间度过的岁月，仅仅成为一种回忆。你曾是一个在我们中间行走的神灵，你的影儿曾明光似的照亮我们的脸。
我们深深地爱了你。不过我们的爱没有声响，而又被轻纱蒙着。
但现在他要对你呼唤，要在你面前揭露。除非临到了别离的时候，爱永远不会知道自己的深浅。
别的人也来向他恳求。他没有答话。他只低着头；靠近他的人看见他的泪落在袜上。
他和众人慢慢地向殿前的广场走去。
有一个名叫爱尔美差的女子从圣殿里出来，她是一个预言者。
他以无限的温蔼注视着她，因为她是在他第一天进这城里的时候，最初寻找相信他的人中之一。
她庆贺他，说：
上帝的先知，至高的探求者，你曾常向远处寻望你的航帆。
现在你的船儿来了，你必须归去。
你对于那回忆的故乡和你更大愿望的居所的渴念，是这样地深，我们的爱，不能把你系住；我们的需求，也不能把你羁留。
但在你别离以前，我们要请你对我们讲说真理。
我们要把这真理传给我们的孩子，他们也传给他们的孩子，如此绵绵不绝。
在你的孤独里，你曾警守我们的白日；在你的清醒里，你曾倾听我们睡梦中的哭泣与欢笑。
现在请把我们的“真我”披露给我们，告诉我们你所知道的关于生和死中间的一切。
他回答说：
阿法利斯的民众呵，除了那现时在你们灵魂里鼓荡的之外，我还能说什么呢？
■　美不是一种需要，只是一种欢乐。
■　只能和你同乐不能和你共苦的人，丢掉了天堂七个门中的一把钥匙。
01
The Coming of the Ship
Almustafa, the chosen and the beloved, who was a dawn onto his own day, had waited twelve years in the city of Orphalese for his ship that was to return and bear him back to the isle of his birth.
And in the twelfth year, on the seventh day of Ielool, the month of reaping, he climbed the hill without the city walls and looked seaward; and he beheld the ship coming with the mist.
Then the gates of his heart were flung open, and his joy flew far over the sea. And he closed his eyes and prayed in the silences of his soul.
But he descended the hill, a sadness came upon him, and he thought in his heart:
How shall I go in peace and without sorrow? Nay, not without a wound in the spirit shall I leave this city.
Long were the days of pain I have spent within its walls, and long were the nights of aloneness; and who can depart from his pain and his aloneness without regret?
Too many fragments of the spirit have I scattered in these streets, and too many are the children of my longing that walk naked among. these hills, and I cannot withdraw from them without a burden and an ache.
It is not a garment I cast off this day, but a skin that I tear with my own hands.
Nor is it a thought I leave behind me, but a heart made sweet with hunger and with thirst.
Yet I cannot tarry longer.
The sea that calls all things unto her calls me, and I must embark.
For to stay, though the hours burn in the night, is to freeze and crystallize and be bound in a mould.
Fain would I take with me all that is here.But how shall I?
A voice cannot carry the tongue and the lips that give it wings. Alone must it seek the ether.
And alone and without his nest shall the eagle fly across the sun.
Now when he reached the foot of the hill, he turned again towards the sea. and he saw his ship approaching the harbour, and upon her prow the mariners, the men of his own land.
And his soul cried out to them, and he said: Sons of my ancient mother, you riders of the tides,
How often have you sailed in my dreams. And now you come in my awakening, which is my deeper dream.
Ready am I to go, and my eagerness with sails full set awaits the wind.
Only another breath will I breathe in this still air, only another loving look cast backward,
Then I shall stand among you, a seafarer among seafarers.
And you, vast sea, sleepless mother.
Who alone are peace and freedom to the river and the stream,
Only another winding will this stream make, only another murmur in this glade.
And then shall I come to you, a boundless drop to a boundless ocean.
And as he walked he saw from afar men and women leaving their fields and their vineyards and hastening towards the city gates.
And he heard their voices calling his name, and shouting from the field to field telling one another of the coming of the ship.
And he said to himself:
Shall the day of parting be the day of gathering?
And shall it be said that my eve was in truth my dawn?
And what shall I give unto him who has left his plough in midfurrow, or to him who has stopped the wheel of his winepress?
Shall my heart become a tree heavy-laden with fruit that I may gather and give unto them?
And shall my desires flow like a fountain that I may fill their cups?
Am I a harp that the hand of the mighty may touch me, or a flute that his breath may pass through me?
A seeker of silences am I, and what treasure have I found in silences that I may dispense with confidence?
If this is my day of harvest, in what fields have I sowed the seed, and in what unremembered seasons?
If this indeed be the hour in which I lift up my lantern, it is not my flame that shall burn therein.
Empty and dark shall I raise my lantern,
And the guardian of the night shall fill it with oil and he shall light it also.
These things he said in words. But much in his heart remained unsaid. For he himself could not speak his deeper secret.
And when he entered into the city all the people came to meet him, and they were crying out to him as with one voice.
And the elders of the city stood forth and said:
Go not yet away from us.
A noontide have you been in our twilight, and your youth has given us dreams to dream.
No stranger are you among us, nor a guest, but our son and our dearly beloved.
Suffer not yet our eyes to hunger for your face.
And the priests and the priestesses said unto him:
Let not the waves of the sea separate us now, and the years you have spent in our midst become a memory.
You have walked among us a spirit, and your shadow has been a light upon our faces.
Much have we loved you, But speechless was our love, and with veils has it been veiled.
Yet now it cries aloud unto you, and would stand revealed before you.
And ever has it been that love knows not its own depth until the hour of separation.
And others came also and entreated him.
But he answered them not. He only bent his head; and those who stood near saw his tears falling upon his breast.
And he and the people proceeded towards the great square before the temple.
And there came out of the sanctuary a woman whose name was Almitra. And she was a seeress.
And he looked upon her with exceeding tenderness, for it was she who had first sought and believed in him when he had been but a day in their city.
And she hailed him, saying:
Prophet of God, in quest for the uttermost. long have you searched the distances for your ship.
And now your ship has come, and you must needs go.
Deep is your longing for the land of your memories and the dwelling place of your greater desires; and our love would not bind you nor our needs hold you.
Yet this we ask ere you leave us, that you speak to us and give us of your truth.
And we will give it unto our children, and they unto their children, and it shall not perish.
In your aloneness you have watched with our days, and in your wakefulness you have listened to the weeping and the laughter of our sleep.
Now therefore disclose us to ourselves, and tell us all that has been shown you of that which is between birth and death.
And he answered,
People of Orphalese, of what can I speak save of that which is even now moving your souls?

[book_title]爱
于是爱尔美差说：请给我们谈爱。
他举头望着民众，他们一时静默了。他用洪亮的声音说：
当爱向你们召唤的时候，跟随着他，虽然他的路程艰险而陡峻。
当他的翅翼围卷你们的时候，屈服于他，虽然那藏在羽翮中间的剑刃许会伤毁你们。
当他对你们说话的时候，信从他，虽然他的声音也许会把你们的梦魂击碎，如同北风吹荒了林园。
爱虽给你加冠，他也要将你钉在十字架上。他虽栽培你，他也刈剪你。
他虽升到你的最高处，抚惜你在日中颤动的枝叶，他也要降到你的根下，摇动你的根柢的一切关节，使之归土。
如同一捆稻粟，他把你束聚起来。
他舂打你使你赤裸。
他筛分你使你脱去皮壳。
他磨碾你直至洁白。他揉搓你直至柔韧；
然后他送你到他的圣火上去，使你成为上帝圣筵上的圣饼。
这些都是爱要给你们做的事情，使你知道自己心中的秘密，在这知识中你便成了“生命心”中的一屑。
假如你在你的疑惧中，只寻求爱的和平与逸乐，那不如掩盖你的裸露，而躲过爱的筛打，
而走入那没有季候的世界，在那里你将欢笑，却不是尽量的笑悦；你将哭泣，却没有流干了眼泪。
爱除自身外无施与，除自身外无接受。
爱不占有，也不被占有。
因为爱在爱中满足了。
当你爱的时候，你不要说，“上帝在我的心中”，却要说，“我在上帝的心里。”
不要想你能导引爱的路程，因为若是他觉得你配，他就导引你。
爱没有别的愿望，只要成全自己。
但若是你爱，而且需求愿望，就让以下的做你的愿望罢：溶化了你自己，像溪流般对清夜吟唱着歌曲。
要知道过度温存的痛苦。
让你对爱的了解毁伤了你自己；而且甘愿地喜乐地流血。
清晨醒起，以喜飏的心来致谢这爱的又一日；
日中静息，默念爱的浓欢；
晚潮退时，感谢地回家；
然后在睡时祈祷，因为有被爱者在你的心中，有赞美之歌在你的唇上。
■　彼此恋爱，却不要做爱的系链。
■　当你爱的时候，你不要说“上帝在我心中”，却要说“我在上帝的心里”
02
On Love
A Then said Almitra, “Speak to us of Love.“ And he raised his head and looked upon the people, and there fell a stillness upon them. And with a great voice he said:
When love beckons to you follow him.
Though his ways are hard and steep.
And when his wings enfold you yield to him.
Though the sword hidden among his pinions may wound you.
And when he speaks to you believe in him.
Though his voice may shatter your dreams as the north wind lays waste the garden.
For even as love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning.
Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your tenderest branches that quiver in the sun,
So shall he descend to your roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth.
Like sheaves of corn he gathers you unto himself.
He threshes you to make you naked.
He sifts you to free you from your husks.
He grinds you to whiteness.
He kneads you until you are pliant;
And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.
All these things shall love do unto you that you may know the secrets of your heart, and in that knowledge become a fragment of Life's heart.
But if in your fear you would seek only love's peace and love's pleasure.
Then it is better for you that you cover your nakedness and pass out of love's threshing-floor,
Into the seasonless world where you shall laugh, but not all of your laughter, and weep, but not all of your tears.
Love gives naught but itself and takes naught but from itself.
Love possesses not nor would it be possessed;
For love is sufficient unto love.
When you love you should not say, “God is in my heart,“ but rather, I am in the heart of God.“
And think not you can direct the course of love, for love, if it finds you worthy, directs your course.
Love has no other desire but to fulfil itself.
But if you love and must needs have desires, let these be your desires:
To melt and be like a running brook that sings its melody to the night.
To know the pain of too much tenderness.
To be wounded by your own understanding of love;
And to bleed willingly and joyfully.
To wake at dawn with a winged heart and give thanks for another day of loving;
To rest at the noon hour and meditate love's ecstasy;
To return home at eventide with gratitude;
And then to sleep with a prayer for the beloved in your heart and a song of praise upon your lips.

[book_title]婚姻
爱尔美差又说，夫子，婚姻怎样讲呢？
他回答说：
你们一块儿出世，也要永远合一。
在死的白翼隔绝你们的岁月的时候，他们也要合一。
噫，连在静默地忆想上帝之时，你们也要合一。
不过在你们合一之中，要有间隙。
让天风在你们中间舞荡。
彼此相爱，但不要做成爱的系链：
只让他在你们灵魂的沙岸中间，做一个流动的海。
彼此斟满了杯，却不要在同一杯中啜饮。
彼此递赠着面包，却不要在同一块上取食。
快乐地在一处舞唱，却仍让彼此静独，
连琴上的那些弦子也是单独的，虽然他们在同一的音调中颤动。
彼此赠献你们的心，却不要互相保留。
因为只有生命的手，才能把持你们的心。
要站在一处，却不要太密迩：
因为殿里的柱子，也是分立在两旁，
橡树和松柏，也不在彼此的荫中生长。
03
On Marriage
Then Almitra spoke again and said, "And what of Marriage, master?"
And he answered saying:
You were born together, and together you shall be forevermore.
You shall be together when white wings of death scatter your days.
Aye, you shall be together even in the silent memory of God.
But let there be spaces in your togetherness,
And let the winds of the heavens dance between you.
Love one another but make not a bond of love:
Let it rather be a moving sea between the shores of your souls.
Fill each other's cup but drink not from one cup.
Give one another of your bread but eat not from the same loaf.
Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone.
Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.
Give your hearts. but not into each other's keeping.
For only the hand of Life can contain your hearts.
And stand together, yet not too near together:
For the pillars of the temple stand apart,
And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.

[book_title]孩子
于是一个怀中抱着孩子的妇人说，请给我们谈孩子。
他说：
你们的孩子，都不是你们的孩子。
乃是生命为自己所渴望的儿女。
他们是凭借你们而来，却不是从你们而来，
他们虽和你们同在，却不属于你们。
你们可以给他们以爱，却不可给他们以思想。
因为他们有自己的思想。
你们可以荫庇他们的身体，却不能荫庇他们的灵魂。
因为他们的灵魂，是住在明日的宅中，那是你们在梦中也不能想见的。
你们可以努力去模仿他们，却不能使他们来像你们。
因为生命是不倒行的，也不与昨日一同停留。
你们是弓，你们的孩子是从弦上发出的生命的箭矢。
那射者在无穷之中看定了目标，也用神力将你们引满，使他的箭矢迅速而遥远地射了出去。
让你们在射者手中的弯曲成为喜乐罢；
因为他爱那飞出的箭，也爱了那静止的弓。
04
On Children
And a woman who held a babe against her bosom said, "Speak to us of Children."
And he said:
Your children are not your children.
They are the sons and daughters of Life's longing for itself.
They come through you but not from you,
And though they are with you, yet they belong not to you.
You may give them your love but not your thoughts.
For they have their own thoughts.
You may house their bodies but not their souls,
For their souls dwell in the house of tomorrow, which you cannot visit, not even in your dreams.
You may strive to be like them, but seek not to make them like you.
For life goes not backward nor tarries with yesterday.
You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer's hand be for gladness:
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.
■　你的心灵常常是战场。在这个战场上，你的理性与判断和你的热情与嗜欲开战。
■　当你达到生命的中心的时候，你将在万物中甚至于在看不见美的人的眼睛里，也会找到美。

[book_title]施与
于是一个富人说，请给我们谈施与。
他回答说：
你把你的产业给人，那只算给了一点。
当你以身布施的时候，那才是真正的施与。
因为你的财产，岂不是你保留着的恐怕明日或许需要它们的东西么？
但是明日，那只过虑的犬，随着香客上圣城去，却把骨头埋在无痕迹的沙土里，明日能把什么给他呢？
除了需要的本身之外，需要还忧惧什么呢？
当你在井泉充溢的时候愁渴，那你的渴不是更难解么？
有人有许多财产，却只把一小部分给人——他们为求名而施与，那潜藏的欲念，使他们的礼物不完美。
有人只有一点财产，却全部都给人。
这些人相信生命和生命的丰富，他们的宝柜总不空虚。
有人喜乐地施与，那喜乐就是他们的酬报。
有人痛苦地施与，那痛苦就是他们的洗礼。
也有人施与了，而不觉出施与的痛苦，也不寻求快乐，也不有心为善；他们的施与，如同那边山谷里的桂花，香气在空际浮动。
从这些人的手中，上帝在说话；在他们的眼后，上帝在俯对大地微笑。
为有请求而施与的，固然是好；而未受请求，只因着默喻而施与的，是更好了。对于乐善好施的人，去寻求需要他帮助的人的快乐，比施与的快乐还大。
有什么东西你必须保留的呢？
必有一天，你的一切都要交付出来；
趁现在施与罢，这施与的时机是你自己的，而不是你的后人的。
你常说：“我要施与，却只要舍给那些配受施与者。”
你果园里的树木，和牧场上的羊群，却不这样说。
他们为要生存而施与，因为保留就是毁灭。
凡是配接受白日和黑夜的人们，都配接受你施与的一切。
凡配在生命的海洋里啜饮的，都配在你的小泉里舀满他的杯。
还有什么德行比接受的勇气、信心和善意还大呢？
有谁能使人把他们的心怀敞露，把他们的狷傲揭开，使你能看出他们赤裸的价值和无惭的骄傲？
先省察你自己是否配做一个施与者，是否配做一个施与的器皿。
因为实在说，那只是生命给予生命——你以为自己是施主，其实也不过是一个证人。
你接受的人们——你们都是接受者——不要掮起报恩的重担，恐怕你要把轭加在你自己和施者的身上。
不如和施者在礼物上一齐展翅飞腾；
因为过于思量你们的欠负，就是怀疑了那以慈悲的大地为母、以上帝为父的人的仁心。

On Giving
Then said a rich man, “Speak to us of Giving.“
And he answered:
You give but little when you give of your possessions.
It is when you give of yourself that you truly give.
For what are your possessions but things you keep and guard for fear you may need them tomorrow?
And tomorrow, what shall tomorrow bring to the over prudent dog burying bones in the trackless sand as he follows the pilgrims to the holy city?
And what is fear of need but need itself?
Is not dread of thirst when your well is full, thirst that is unquenchable?
There are those who give little of the much which they have-and they give it for recognition and their hidden desire makes their gifts unwholesome.
And there are those who have little and give it all.
These are the believers in life and the bounty of life, and their coffer is never empty.
There are those who give with joy, and that joy is their reward.
And there are those who give with pain, and that pain is their baptism.
And there are those who give and know not pain in giving, nor do they seek joy, nor give with mindfulness of virtue;
They give as in yonder valley the myrtle breathes its fragrance into space.
Through the hands of such as these God speaks, and from behind their eyes He smiles upon the earth.
It is well to give when asked, but it is better to give unasked, through understanding;
And to the open-handed the search for one who shall receive is joy greater than giving
And is there aught you would withhold?
All you have shall some day be given;
Therefore give now, that the season of giving may be yours and not your inheritors'.
You often say, “I would give, but only to the deserving.“
The trees in your orchard say not so, nor the flocks in your pasture.
They give that they may live, for to withhold is to perish.
Surely he who is worthy to receive his days and his nights is worthy of all else from you.
And he who has deserved to drink from the ocean of life deserves to fill his cup from your little stream.
And what desert greater shall there be than that which lies in the courage and the confidence, nay the charity, of receiving?
And who are you that men should rend their bosom and unveil their pride, that you may see their worth naked and their pride unabashed?
See first that you yourself deserve to be a giver, and an instrument of giving.
For in truth it is life that gives unto life-while you, who deem yourself a giver, are but a witness.
And you receivers-and you are all receivers-assume no weight of gratitude, lest you lay a yoke upon yourself and upon him who gives.
Rather rise together with the giver on his gifts as on wings;
For to be over mindful of your debt, is to doubt his generosity who has the free-hearted earth for mother, and God for father.

[book_title]饮食
一个开饭店的老人说，请给我们谈饮食。
他说：
我恨不得你们能依靠大地的香气而生存，如同植物受着阳光、空气的供养。
既然你们必须杀生为食，而且从新生的动物口中夺他的母乳来止渴，那就让他成为一个敬神的礼节吧。
让你的肴馔摆在祭坛上，那是丛林中和原野上的纯洁清白的物品，为更纯洁清白的人们而牺牲的。
当你杀生的时候，心里对他说：
“在宰杀你的权力之下，我同样地也被宰杀，我也要同样地被吞噬。
那把你送到我手里的法律，也要把我送到那更伟大者的手里。
你和我的血都不过是浇灌天树的一种液汁。”
当你咬嚼着苹果的时候，心里对它说：
“你的子核要在我身中生长，
你来世的嫩芽要在我心中萌茁，
你的芬香要成为我的气息，
我们要终年的喜乐。”
在秋天，你在果园里摘葡萄榨酒的时候，心里说：
“我也是一座葡萄园，我的果实也要摘下榨酒。和新酒一般，我也要被收存在永生的杯里。”
在冬日，当你斟酒的时候，你的心要对每一杯酒歌唱；让那歌曲成为一首纪念秋天和葡萄园以及榨酒之歌。
06
On Eating and Drinking
Then an old man, a keeper of an inn, said, "Speak to us of Eating and Drinking."
And he said:
Would that you could live on the fragrance of the earth, and like an air plant be sustained by the light.
But since you must kill to eat, and rob the young of its mother's milk to quench your thirst, let it then be an act of worship,
And let your board stand an altar on which the pure and the innocent of forest and plain are sacrificed for that which is purer and still more innocent in many.
When you kill a beast say to him in your heart,
"By the same power that slays you, I to am slain; and I too shall be consumed.
For the law that delivered you into my hand shall deliver me into a mightier hand.
Your blood and my blood is naught but the sap that feeds the tree of heaven."
And when you crush an apple with your teeth, say to it in your heart,
"Your seeds shall live in my body,
"And the buds of your tomorrow shall blossom in my heart,
"And your fragrance shall be my breath,
"And together we shall rejoice through all the seasons."
And in the autumn, when you gather the grapes of your vineyard for the winepress, say in you heart,
"I to am a vineyard, and my fruit shall be gathered for the winepress,
"And like new wine I shall be kept in eternal vessels."
And in winter, when you draw the wine, let there be in your heart a song for each cup;
And let there be in the song a remembrance for the autumn days, and for the vineyard, and for the winepress.

[book_title]工作
于是一个农夫说，请给我们谈工作。
他回答说：
你工作为的是要与大地和大地的精神一同前进。
因为情逸使你成为一个时代的生客，一个生命大队中的落伍者，这大队是庄严的，高傲而服从的，向着无穷前进。
在你工作的时候，你是一管笛，从你心中吹出时光的微语，变成音乐。
你们谁肯做一根芦管，在万物合唱的时候，你独痴呆无声呢？
你们常听人说，工作是祸殃，劳动是不幸。
我却对你们说，你们工作的时候，你们完成了大地深远的梦之一部，他指示你那梦是从何时开头的。
而在你劳动不息的时候，你确实爱了生命。
在工作里爱了生命，就是通彻了生命最深的秘密。
倘然在你的辛苦里，将有身之苦恼和养身之诅咒，写上你的眉间，则我将回答你，只有你眉间的汗，能洗去这些字句。
你们也听见人说，生命是黑暗的。在你疲劳之中，你附和了那疲劳的人所说的话。
我说生命的确是黑暗的，除非是有了激励；
一切的知识都是徒然的，除非是有了工作；
一切的工作都是空虚的，除非是有了爱。
当你仁爱地工作的时候，你便与自己、与人类、与上帝联系为一。
怎样才是仁爱的工作呢？
从你的心中抽丝织成布帛，仿佛你的爱者要来穿此衣裳。
热情地盖造房屋，仿佛你的爱者要住在其中。
温存地播种，欢乐地收刈，仿佛你的爱者要来吃这产物。
这就是用你自己灵魂的气息，来充满你所制造的一切。
要知道一切受福的古人，都在你上头看视着。
我常听见你们仿佛在梦中说：“那在蜡石上表现出他自己灵魂的形象的人，是比耕地的人高贵多了。
那捉住虹霓，传神地画在布帛上的人，是比织履的人强多了。”
我却要说，不在梦中，而在正午清醒的时候，风对大橡树说话的声音，并不比对纤小的草叶所说的更甜柔。
只有那用他的爱心，把风声变成甜柔的歌曲的人，是伟大的。
工作是眼能看见的爱。
倘若你不是欢乐地却厌恶地工作，那还不如撇下工作，坐在大殿的门边，去乞求那些欢乐地工作的人的周济。
倘若你无精打采地烤着面包，你烤成的面包是苦的，只能救半个人的饥饿。
你若是怨重地压榨着葡萄酒，你的怨望，在酒里滴下了毒液。
倘若你能像天使一般地唱，却不爱唱，那你就把人们能听到白天和黑夜的声音的耳朵都塞住了。
■　听真理的并不弱于讲真理的人。
■　生活是黑暗的，除非有了激励；一切激励是盲目的，除非有了知识；一切知识都是徒然的，除非有了工作；一切工作是虚空的，除非有了爱。
07
On Work
Then a ploughman said, “Speak to us of Work.“
And he answered, saying:
You work that you may keep pace with the earth and the soul of the earth.
For to be idle is to become a stranger unto the seasons, and to step out of life's procession, that marches in majesty and proud submission towards the infinite.
When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music.
Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?
Always you have been told that work is a curse and labour a misfortune.
But I say to you that when you work you fulfil a part of earth's furthest dream, assigned to you when that dream was born,
And in keeping yourself with labour you are in truth loving life,
And to love life through labour is to be intimate with life's inmost secret.
But if you in your pain call birth an affliction and the support of the flesh a curse written upon your brow, then I answer that naught but the sweat of your brow shall wash away that which is written.
You have been told also life is darkness, and in your weariness you echo what was said by the weary.
And I say that life is indeed darkness save when there is urge,
And all urge is blind save when there is knowledge,
And all knowledge is vain save when there is work,
And all work is empty save when there is love;
And when you work with love you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God.
And what is it to work with love?
It is to weave the cloth with threads drawn from your heart, even as if your beloved were to wear that cloth.
It is to build a house with affection, even as if your beloved were to dwell in that house.
It is to sow seeds with tenderness and reap the harvest with joy, even as if your beloved were to eat the fruit.
It is to charge all things you fashion with a breath of your own spirit,
And to know that all the blessed dead are standing about you and watching.
Often have I heard you say, as if speaking in sleep, “he who works in marble, and finds the shape of his own soul in the stone, is a nobler than he who ploughs the soil.
“And he who seizes the rainbow to lay it on a cloth in the likeness of man, is more than he who makes the sandals for our feet.“
But I say, not in sleep but in the over-wakefulness of noontide, that the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks than to the least of all the blades of grass;
And he alone is great who turns the voice of the wind into a song made sweeter by his own loving.
Work is love made visible.
And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy.
For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger.
And if you grudge the crushing of the grapes, your grudge distils a poison in the wine.
And if you sing though as angels, and love not the singing, you muffle man's ears to the voices of the day and the voices of the night.

[book_title]欢乐与悲哀
于是一个妇人说，请给我们讲欢乐与悲哀。
他回答说：
你的欢乐，就是你去了面具的悲哀。
连你那涌溢欢乐的井泉，也常是充满了你的眼泪。
不然又怎样呢？
悲哀的创痕在你身上刻得越深，你越能容受更多的欢乐。
你的盛酒的杯，不就是那曾在陶工的窑中燃烧的坯子么？
那感悦你的心神的笛子，不就是曾受尖刀挖刻的木管么？
当你欢乐的时候，深深地内顾你的心中，你就知道只不过是曾使你悲哀的，又在使你欢乐。
当你悲哀的时候，再内顾你的心中，你就看出实在是那曾使你喜悦的，又在使你哭泣。
你们有些人说：“欢乐大于悲哀。”也有人说：“不，悲哀是更大的。”我却要对你们说，它们是不能分开的。
它们一同来到，当这一个和你同席的时候，要记得那一个正在你床上酣眠。真的，你是天平般悬在悲哀与欢乐之间。
只有在盘空的时候，你才能静止，持平。
当守库者把你提起来称他的金银的时候，你的哀乐就必需升降了。
08
On Joy & Sorrow
Then a woman said, "Speak to us of Joy and Sorrow."
And he answered:
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
And the selfsame well from which your laughter rises was oftentimes filled with your tears.
And how else can it be?
The deeper that sorrow carves into your being, the more joy you can contain.
Is not the cup that hold your wine the very cup that was burned in the potter's oven?
And is not the lute that soothes your spirit, the very wood that was hollowed with knives?
When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow that is giving you joy.
When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.
Some of you say, "Joy is greater than sorrow," and others say, "Nay, sorrow is the greater."
But I say unto you, they are inseparable.
Together they come, and when one sits alone with you at your board, remember that the other is asleep upon your bed.
Verily you are suspended like scales between your sorrow and your joy.
Only when you are empty are you at standstill and balanced.
When the treasure-keeper lifts you to weigh his gold and his silver, needs must your joy or your sorrow rise or fall.

[book_title]居室
于是一个泥水匠走上前来说，请给我们谈居室。
他回答说：
当你在城里盖一所房子之前，先在野外用你的想象盖一座凉亭。
因为你黄昏时有家可归，而你那更迷茫、更孤寂的漂泊的精魂，也有个归宿。
你的房屋是你的较大的躯壳。
他在阳光中发育，在夜的寂静中睡眠；而且不能无梦。
你的房屋不做梦么？不梦见离开城市，登山入林么？
我愿能把你们的房子聚握在手里，撒种似的把他们洒落在丛林中与绿野上。
愿山谷成为你们的街市，绿径成为你们的里巷，使你们在葡萄园中相寻相访的时候，衣袂上带着大地的芬芳。
但这个还一时做不到。
在你们祖宗的忧惧里，他们把你们聚集得太近了。这忧惧还要稍微延长。你们的城墙，也仍要把你们的家庭和你们的田地分开的。
告诉我罢，阿法利斯的民众呵，你们的房子里有什么？你们锁门是为守护什么呢？
你们有和平，不就是那表现好魄力的宁静和鼓励么？
你们有回忆，不就是那连跨你心峰的灿烂的弓桥么？
你们有美，不就是那把你的心从木石建筑上引到圣山的么？
告诉我，你们的房屋里有这些东西么？
或者你只有舒适和舒适的欲念，那诡秘的东西，以客人的身份混了进来渐作家人，终作主翁的么？
噫，他变成一个驯兽的人，用钩镰和鞭笞，使你较伟大的愿望变成傀儡。
他的手虽柔软如丝，他的心却是铁打的。
他催眠你，只须站在你的床侧，讥笑你肉体的尊严。
他戏弄你健全的感官，把它们塞放在蓟绒里，如同脆薄的杯盘。
真的，舒适之欲，杀害了你灵性的热情，又哂笑地在你的殡仪队中徐步。
但是你们这些太空的儿女，你们在静中不息，你们不应当被网罗，被驯养。
你们的房子不应当作个锚，却应当作个桅。
它不应当作一片遮掩伤痕的闪亮的薄皮，却应当作那保护眼睛的睫毛。
你不应当为穿门走户而敛翅，也不应当为恐触到屋顶而低头，也不应当为怕墙壁崩裂而停止呼吸。
你不应当住在那死人替活人筑造的坟墓里。
无论你的房屋是如何的壮丽与辉煌，也不应当使他隐住你的秘密，遮住你的愿望。
因为你里面的无穷性，是住在天宫里，那天宫是以晓烟为门户，以夜的静寂与歌曲为窗牖的。
09
On Houses
Then a mason came forth and said, “Speak to us of Houses.“
And he answered and said:
Build of your imaginings a bower in the wilderness ere you build a house within the city walls.
For even as you have home-comings in your twilight, so has the wanderer in you, the ever distant and alone.
Your house is your larger body.
It grows in the sun and sleeps in the stillness of the night; and it is not dreamless. Does not your house dream? And dreaming, leave the city for grove or hilltop?
Would that I could gather your houses into my hand, and like a sower scatter them in forest and meadow.
Would the valleys were your streets, and the green paths your alleys, that you might seek one another through vineyards, and come with the fragrance of the earth in your garments.
But these things are not yet to be.
In their fear your forefathers gathered you too near together. And that fear shall endure a little longer. A little longer shall your city walls separate your hearths from your fields.
And tell me, people of Orphalese, what have you in these houses? And what is it you guard with fastened doors?
Have you peace, the quiet urge that reveals your power?
Have you remembrances, the glimmering arches that span the summits of the mind?
Have you beauty, that leads the heart from things fashioned of wood and stone to the holy mountain?
Tell me, have you these in your houses?
Or have you only comfort, and the lust for comfort, that stealthy thing that enters the house a guest, and becomes a host, and then a master?
Ay, and it becomes a tamer, and with hook and scourge makes puppets of your larger desires.
Though its hands are silken, its heart is of iron.
It lulls you to sleep only to stand by your bed and jeer at the dignity of the flesh.
It makes mock of your sound senses, and lays them in thistledown like fragile vessels.
Verily the lust for comfort murders the passion of the soul, and then walks grinning in the funeral.
But you, children of space, you restless in rest, you shall not be trapped nor tamed.
Your house shall be not an anchor but a mast.
It shall not be a glistening film that covers a wound, but an eyelid that guards the eye.
You shall not fold your wings that you may pass through doors, nor bend your heads that they strike not against a ceiling, nor fear to breathe lest walls should crack and fall down.
You shall not dwell in tombs made by the dead for the living.
And though of magnificence and splendour, your house shall not hold your secret nor shelter your longing.
For that which is boundless in you abides in the mansion of the sky, whose door is the morning mist, and whose windows are the songs and the silences of night.
■　一个人的意义不在于他的成就，而在于他所企求成就的东西。
■　别有寄托的友谊，不是真正的友谊，而是撒入生活海洋里的网，到头来空收无益。
■　理性与热情是航行的灵魂的舵和帆，假如你的帆或舵破坏了，只能泛荡。漂流或在海中停住。
■　虽然言语的波浪永远在我们上面喧哗，而我们的深处却永远是沉默的。

[book_title]衣服
于是一个织工说，请给我们谈衣服。
他回答说：
你们的衣服掩盖了许多的美，却遮不住丑恶。
你们虽可在衣服里找到隐秘的自由，却也找到了橛饰与羁勒了。
我恨不得你们多用皮肤而少用衣服去迎接太阳和风。
因为生命的气息是在阳光中，生命的把握是在风里。
你们中有人说：“那纺织衣服给我们穿的是北风。”
我也说：对的，是北风，
但他的机杼是可羞的，那使筋肌软弱的是他的线缕。
当他的工作完毕时，他在林中喧笑。
不要忘却，羞怯只是遮挡不洁的眼目的盾牌。
在不洁完全没有了的时候，羞怯不是仅仅是心上的桎梏与束缚么？
也别忘了大地是欢喜和你的赤脚接触，风是希望和你的头发游戏的。
10
On Clothes
And the weaver said, "Speak to us of Clothes."
And he answered:
Your clothes conceal much of your beauty, yet they hide not the unbeautiful.
And though you seek in garments the freedom of privacy you may find in them a harness and a chain.
Would that you could meet the sun and the wind with more of your skin and less of your raiment,
For the breath of life is in the sunlight and the hand of life is in the wind.
Some of you say, "It is the north wind who has woven the clothes to wear."
But shame was his loom, and the softening of the sinews was his thread.
And when his work was done he laughed in the forest.
Forget not that modesty is for a shield against the eye of the unclean.
And when the unclean shall be no more, what were modesty but a fetter and a fouling of the mind?
And forget not that the earth delights to feel your bare feet and the winds long to play with your hair.

[book_title]买卖
于是一个商人说，请给我们谈买卖。
他回答说：
大地贡献果实给你们，如果你们只晓得怎样独取，你们就不应当领受了。在交易着大地的礼物时，你们将感到丰裕而满足。
然而若不是用爱和公平来交易，则必有人流为饕餮，有人流为饿殍。
当在市场上，你们这些海上、田中和葡萄园里的工人，遇见了织工、陶工和采集香料的——
就当祈求大地的主神，临到你们中间，来圣化天秤，以及那较量价值的核算。
不要容许游手好闲的人来参加你们的买卖，他们会以言语来换取你们的劳力。
你们要对这种人说：
“同我们到田间，或者跟我们的兄弟到海上去撒网；
“因为海与陆地，对你们也和对我们一样地慈惠。”
倘若那吹箫的和歌舞的人来了，你们也应当买他们的礼物。
因为他们也是果实和乳香的采集者，他们带来的物事，虽系梦幻，却是你们灵魂上的衣食。
在你们离开市场以前，要看着没有人空手回去。
因为大地的主神，不到你们每人的需要全都满足了以后，他不能在风中宁静地睡眠。
11
On Buying & Selling
And a merchant said, "Speak to us of Buying and Selling."
And he answered and said:
To you the earth yields her fruit, and you shall not want if you but know how to fill your hands.
It is in exchanging the gifts of the earth that you shall find abundance and be satisfied.
Yet unless the exchange be in love and kindly justice, it will but lead some to greed and others to hunger.
When in the market place you toilers of the sea and fields and vineyards meet the weavers and the potters and the gatherers of spices,-
Invoke then the master spirit of the earth, to come into your midst and sanctify the scales and the reckoning that weighs value against value.
And suffer not the barren-handed to take part in your transactions, who would sell their words for your labour.
To such men you should say,
"Come with us to the field, or go with our brothers to the sea and cast your net;
For the land and the sea shall be bountiful to you even as to us."
And if there come the singers and the dancers and the flute players, - buy of their gifts also.
For they too are gatherers of fruit and frankincense, and that which they bring, though fashioned of dreams, is raiment and food for your soul.
And before you leave the marketplace, see that no one has gone his way with empty hands.
For the master spirit of the earth shall not sleep peacefully upon the wind till the needs of the least of you are satisfied.

[book_title]罪与罚
于是本城的法官中，有一个走上前来说，请给我们谈罪与罚。
他回答说：
当你的灵性随风飘荡的时候，
你孤零而失慎地对别人也就是对自己犯了过错。
为着所犯的过错，你必须去叩那受福者之门，要被怠慢地等待片刻。
你们的“神性”像海洋；
他永远纯洁不染，
又像以太，他只帮助有翼者上升。
他们的“神性”也像太阳；
他不知道田鼠的径路，也不寻找蛇虺的洞穴。
但是你们的“神性”，不是独居在你们里面。
在你们里面，有些仍是“人性”，有些还不成“人性”。
只是一个未成形的侏儒，睡梦中在烟雾里蹒跚，自求觉醒。
我现在所要说的，就是你们的“人性”。
因为那知道罪与罪的刑罚的，是他，而不是你的“神性”，也不是烟雾中的侏儒。
我常听见你们论议到一个犯了过失的人，仿佛他不是你们的同人，只像是个外人，是个你们的世界中的闯入者。
我却要说，连那圣洁和正直的，也不能高于你们每人心中的至善。
所以那奸邪的懦弱的，也不能低于你们心中的极恶。
如同一片树叶，除非得到全树的默许，不能独自变黄。
所以那作恶者，若没有你们大家无形中的怂恿，也不会作恶。
如同一个队伍，你们一同向着你们的“神性”前进。
你们是道，也是行道的人。
当你们中间有人跌倒的时候，他是为了他后面的人而跌倒，是一块绊脚石的警告。
是的，他也为他前面的人而跌倒，因为他们的步履虽然又快又稳，却没有把那绊脚石挪开。
还有这个，虽然这些话会重压你的心：
被杀者对于自己的被杀不能不负疚，被劫者对于自己的被劫不能不受责。
正直的人，对于恶人的行为，也不能算无辜。
清白的人，对于罪人的过犯，也不能算不染。
是的，罪犯往往是被害者的牺牲品，
刑徒更往往为那些无罪无过的人肩负罪担。
你们不能把至公与不公，至善与不善分开；因为他们一齐站在太阳面前，如同织在一起的黑线和白线，
黑线断了的时候，织工就要视察整块的布，也要察看那机杼。
你们中如有人要审判一个不忠诚的妻子，
让他也拿天平来称一称她丈夫的心，拿尺来量一量他的灵魂。
让鞭挞“扰人者”的人，先察一察那“被扰者”的灵性。
你们如有人要以正义之名，砍伐一棵恶树，让他先察看树根；
他一定能看出那好的与坏的，能结实与不能结实的树根，都在大地的沉默的心中，纠结在一处。
你们这些愿持公正的法官，
你们将怎样裁判那忠诚其外而盗窃其中的人？
你们又将怎样刑罚一个受戮肉体，而在他自己是心灵遭灭的人？
你们又将怎样控告那行为上刁猾、暴戾，
而事实上也是被威逼、被虐待的人呢？
你们又将怎样责罚那悔心已经大于过失的人？
忏悔不就是你们所喜欢奉行的法定的公道么？
然而你们却不能将忏悔放在无辜者的身上，也不能将它从罪人心中取出。
不期然地它要在夜中呼唤，使人们醒起，反躬自省。
你们这些愿意了解公道的人，若不在大光明中视察一切的行为，你们怎能了解呢？
■　和你一同笑过的人，你可能把他忘掉；但是和你一同哭过的人，你却永远不忘。
■　愿除了寻求心灵的加深之外，友谊没有别的目的。
只在那时，你们才知道那直立与跌倒的，只是一个站在侏儒性的黑夜与神性的白日的黄昏中的人，也要知道那大殿的角石，也不高于那最低的基石。
12
On Crime & Punishment
Then one of the judges of the city stood forth and said, “Speak to us of Crime and Punishment.“
And he answered saying:
It is when your spirit goes wandering upon the wind.
That you, alone and unguarded, commit a wrong unto others and therefore unto yourself.
And for that wrong committed must you knock and wait a while unheeded at the gate of the blessed.
Like the ocean is your god-self;
It remains for ever undefiled.
And like the ether it lifts but the winged.
Even like the sun is your god-self;
It knows not the ways of the mole nor seeks it the holes of the serpent.
But your god-self does not dwell alone in your being.
Much in you is still man, and much in you is not yet man,
But a shapeless pigmy that walks asleep in the mist searching for its own awakening.
And of the man in you would I now speak.
For it is he and not your god-self nor the pigmy in the mist, that knows crime and the punishment of crime.
Oftentimes have I heard you speak of one who commits a wrong as though he were not one of you, but a stranger unto you and an intruder upon your world.
But I say that even as the holy and the righteous cannot rise beyond the highest which is in each one of you,
So the wicked and the weak cannot fall lower than the lowest which is in you also.
And as a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree,
So the wrong-doer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all.
Like a procession you walk together towards your god-self.
You are the way and the wayfarers.
And when one of you falls down he falls for those behind him, a caution against the stumbling stone.
Ay, and he falls for those ahead of him, who though faster and surer of foot, yet removed not the stumbling stone.
And this also, though the word lie heavy upon your hearts:
The murdered is not unaccountable for his own murder,
And the robbed is not blameless in being robbed.
The righteous is not innocent of the deeds of the wicked,
And the white-handed is not clean in the doings of the felon.
Yea, the guilty is oftentimes the victim of the injured,
And still more often the condemned is the burden-bearer for the guiltless and unblamed.
You cannot separate the just from the unjust and the good from the wicked;
For they stand together before the face of the sun even as the black thread and the white are woven together.
And when the black thread breaks, the weaver shall look into the whole cloth, and he shall examine the loom also.
If any of you would bring judgment the unfaithful wife,
Let him also weight the heart of her husband in scales, and measure his soul with measurements.
And let him who would lash the offender look unto the spirit of the offended.
And if any of you would punish in the name of righteousness and lay the ax unto the evil tree, let him see to its roots;
And verily he will find the roots of the good and the bad, the fruitful and the fruitless, all entwined together in the silent heart of the earth.
And you judges who would be just,
What judgment pronounce you upon him who though honest in the flesh yet is a thief in spirit?
What penalty lay you upon him who slays in the flesh yet is himself slain in the spirit?
And how prosecute you him who in action is a deceiver and an oppressor,
Yet who also is aggrieved and outraged?
And how shall you punish those whose remorse is already greater than their misdeeds?
Is not remorse the justice which is administered by that very law which you would fain serve?
Yet you cannot lay remorse upon the innocent nor lift it from the heart of the guilty.
Unbidden shall it call in the night, that men may wake and gaze upon themselves.
And you who would understand justice, how shall you unless you look upon all deeds in the fullness of light?
Only then shall you know that the erect and the fallen are but one man standing in twilight between the night of his pigmy-self and the day of his god-self,
And that the corner-stone of the temple is not higher than the lowest stone in its foundation.

[book_title]法律
于是一个律师说，但是，我们的法律怎么样呢，夫子？
他回答说：你们喜欢立法，
却也更喜欢犯法。
如同那在海滨游戏的孩子，勤恳地建造了沙塔，然后又嬉笑地将它毁坏。
但是当你们建造沙塔的时候，海洋又送许多的沙土上来，
到你们毁坏那沙塔的时候，海洋又与你们一同哄笑。
真的，海洋常和天真的人一同哄笑。
可是对于那班不以生命为海洋，不以人造的法律为沙塔的人又当如何？
对于那以生命为岩石，以法律为可以随意刻雕的凿子的人，又当如何？
对于那憎恶跳舞者的跛人又当如何？
对于那喜爱羁轭，却以小牛和林中的麋鹿为流离颠沛的人，又当如何？
对于自己不能蜕脱，却把一切蛇豸称为赤裸无耻的老蛇的人，又当如何？
对于那早赴婚筵，饱倦归来，却说“一切筵席都是违法，那些设筵的人都是犯法者”的人又当如何？
对于这些人，除了说他们是站在日中以背向阳之外，我能说什么呢？
他们只看见自己的影子。他们的影子，就是他们的法律。
太阳对于他们，不只是一个射影者么？
承认法律，不就是佝偻着在地上寻迹阴影么？
你们只向着阳光行走的人，地上哪种的映影能捉住你们呢？
你们这乘风遨游的人，哪种的风信旗能指示你们的路程呢？
如果你们不在任何人的囚室门前敲碎你们的镣铐，那种人造的法律能束缚你们么？
如果你们跳舞，却不撞击任何人的铁链，你们还怕什么法律呢？
如果你们撕脱你们的衣囊，却不丢弃在任何人的道上，有谁能把你带去受审呢？
阿法利斯的民众呵，你们纵能闷住鼓音，松了琴弦，但有谁能禁止云雀不高唱？

On Laws
Then a lawyer said, "But what of our Laws, master?"
And he answered:
You delight in laying down laws,
Yet you delight more in breaking them.
Like children playing by the ocean who build sand-towers with constancy and then destroy them with laughter.
But while you build your sand-towers the ocean brings more sand to the shore,
And when you destroy them, the ocean laughs with you.
Verily the ocean laughs always with the innocent.
But what of those to whom life is not an ocean, and man-made laws are not sand-towers,
But to whom life is a rock, and the law a chisel with which they would carve it in their own likeness?
What of the cripple who hates dancers?
What of the ox who loves his yoke and deems the elk and deer of the forest stray and vagrant things?
What of the old serpent who cannot shed his skin, and calls all others naked and shameless?
And of him who comes early to the wedding-feast, and when over-fed and tired goes his way saying that all feasts are violation and all feasters law-breakers?
What shall I say of these save that they too stand in the sunlight, but with their backs to the sun?
They see only their shadows, and their shadows are their laws.
And what is the sun to them but a caster of shadows?
And what is it to acknowledge the laws but to stoop down and trace their shadows upon the earth?
But you who walk facing the sun, what images drawn on the earth can hold you?
You who travel with the wind, what weathervane shall direct your course?
What man's law shall bind you if you break your yoke but upon no man's prison door?
What laws shall you fear if you dance but stumble against no man's iron chains?
And who is he that shall bring you to judgment if you tear off your garment yet leave it in no man's path?
People of Orphalese, you can muffle the drum, and you can loosen the strings of the lyre, but who shall command the skylark not to sing?

[book_title]自由
于是一个辩士说，请给我们谈自由。
他回答说：
在城门边，在炉火光前，我曾看见你们俯伏敬拜自己的“自由”，
甚至于像那些囚奴，在诛戮他们的暴君之前卑屈，颂赞。
噫，在庙宇的林中，在城堡的影里，我曾看见你们中之最自由者，把自由像枷铐似的戴上。
我心里忧伤，因为只有那求自由的愿望也成了羁饰，你们再不以自由为标杆、为成就的时候，你们才是自由了。
当你们的白日不是没有牵挂，你们的黑夜也不是没有愿望与忧愁的时候，你们才是自由了。
不如说是当那些事物包围住你的生命，而你却能赤裸地无牵挂地超腾的时候，你们才是自由了。
但若不是在你们了解的晓光中，折断了捆绑你们昼气的锁链，你们怎能超脱你们的白日和黑夜呢？
实话说，你们所谓的自由，就是最坚牢的锁链，虽然那链环闪烁在日光中，炫耀了你们的眼目。
“自由”岂不是你们自身的碎片？你们愿意将它抛弃换得自由么？
假如那是你们所要废除的一条不公平的法律，那法律却是你们用自己的手写在自己的额上的。
你们虽烧毁你们的律书，倾全海的水来冲洗你们法官的额，也不能把它抹掉。
假如那是个你们所要废黜的暴君，先看他的建立在你心中的宝座是否毁坏。
因为一个暴君怎能辖制自由和自尊的人呢？除非他们自己的自由是专制的，他们的自尊是可羞的。
假如那是一种你们所要抛掷的牵挂，那牵挂是你自取的，不是别人勉强给你的。
假如那是一种你们所要消灭的恐怖，那恐怖的座位是在你的心中，而不在你所恐怖的人的手里。
真的，一切在你里面运行的事物，愿望与恐怖，憎恶与爱怜，追求与退避，都是永恒地互抱着。
这些事物在你里面运行，如同光明与黑影成对地胶粘着。
当黑影消灭的时候，遗留的光明又变成另一种光明的黑影。这样，当你们的自由脱去它的镣铐的时候，它本身又变成更大的自由的镣铐了。

On Freedom
And an orator said, "Speak to us of Freedom."
And he answered:
At the city gate and by your fireside I have seen you prostrate yourself and worship your own freedom,
Even as slaves humble themselves before a tyrant and praise him though he slays them.
Ay, in the grove of the temple and in the shadow of the citadel I have seen the freest among you wear their freedom as a yoke and a handcuff.
And my heart bled within me; for you can only be free when even the desire of seeking freedom becomes a harness to you, and when you cease to speak of freedom as a goal and a fulfillment.
You shall be free indeed when your days are not without a care nor your nights without a want and a grief,
But rather when these things girdle your life and yet you rise above them naked and unbound.
■　人生的一切都是美好的，甚至连金钱也是一样，因为它会给人们以教益。
■　一个羞赧的失败比一个骄傲的成功还要高贵。
And how shall you rise beyond your days and nights unless you break the chains which you at the dawn of your understanding have fastened around your noon hour?
In truth that which you call freedom is the strongest of these chains, though its links glitter in the sun and dazzle the eyes.
And what is it but fragments of your own self you would discard that you may become free?
If it is an unjust law you would abolish, that law was written with your own hand upon your own forehead.
You cannot erase it by burning your law books nor by washing the foreheads of your judges, though you pour the sea upon them.
And if it is a despot you would dethrone, see first that his throne erected within you is destroyed.
For how can a tyrant rule the free and the proud, but for a tyranny in their own freedom and a shame in their won pride?
And if it is a care you would cast off, that care has been chosen by you rather than imposed upon you.
And if it is a fear you would dispel, the seat of that fear is in your heart and not in the hand of the feared.
Verily all things move within your being in constant half embrace, the desired and the dreaded, the repugnant and the cherished, the pursued and that which you would escape.
These things move within you as lights and shadows in pairs that cling.
And when the shadow fades and is no more, the light that lingers becomes a shadow to another light.
And thus your freedom when it loses its fetters becomes itself the fetter of a greater freedom.

[book_title]理性与热情
于是那女冠又说：请给我们讲理性与热情。
他回答说：
他们的心灵常常是战场。在战场上，你们的“理性与判断”和你们的“热情与嗜欲”开战。
我恨不能在你们的心灵中做一个调停者，使我可以让你们心中的分子从竞争与衅隙变成合一与和鸣。
但除了你们自己也做个调停者，做个你们心中的各分子的爱者之外，我又能做什么呢？
你们的理性与热情，是你们航行的灵魂的舵与帆。
假如你们的帆或舵破坏了，你们只能泛荡、漂流，或在海中停住。
因为理性独自治理，是一个禁锢的权力；热情，不小心的时候是一个自焚的火焰。
因此，让你们的心灵把理性升到热情的最高点，让它歌唱；
也让心灵用理性来引导你们的热情，让它在每日复活中生存，如同大鸾在它自己的灰烬上高翔。
我愿你们把判断和嗜欲当作你们家中的两位佳客。
你们自然不能敬礼一客过于另一客；因为过分关心于任一客，必要失去两客的友爱与忠诚。
在万山中，当你坐在白杨的凉荫下，享受那远田与原野的宁静与和平——你应当让你的心在沉静中说：“上帝安息在理性中。”
当飓暴卷来的时候，狂风震撼林木，雷电宣告穹苍的威严——你应当让你的心在敬畏中说：“上帝运行在热情里。”
只因你们是上帝大气中之一息，是上帝丛林中之一叶，你们也要同他一起安息在理性中，运行在热情里。
15
On Reason & Passion
And the priestess spoke again and said: "Speak to us of Reason and Passion."
And he answered saying:
Your soul is oftentimes a battlefield, upon which your reason and your judgment wage war against passion and your appetite.
Would that I could be the peacemaker in your soul, that I might turn the discord and the rivalry of your elements into oneness and melody.
But how shall I, unless you yourselves be also the peacemakers, nay, the lovers of all your elements?
Your reason and your passion are the rudder and the sails of your seafaring soul.
If either your sails or our rudder be broken, you can but toss and drift, or else be held at a standstill in mid-seas.
For reason, ruling alone, is a force confining; and passion, unattended, is a flame that burns to its own destruction.
Therefore let your soul exalt your reason to the height of passion; that it may sing;
And let it direct your passion with reason, that your passion may live through its own daily resurrection, and like the phoenix rise above its own ashes.
I would have you consider your judgment and your appetite even as you would two loved guests in your house.
Surely you would not honour one guest above the other; for he who is more mindful of one loses the love and the faith of both.
Among the hills, when you sit in the cool shade of the white poplars, sharing the peace and serenity of distant fields and meadows-then let your heart say in silence, "God rests in reason."
And when the storm cones, and the mighty wind shakes the forest, and thunder and lightning proclaim the majesty of the sky, - then let your heart say in awe, "God moves in passion."
And since you are a breath In God's sphere, and a leaf in God's forest, you too should rest in reason and move in passion.

[book_title]苦痛
于是一个妇人说，请给我们谈苦痛。
他说：
你的苦痛是你那包裹知识的皮壳的破碎。
连果核也必须破碎，使果仁可以暴露在阳光中，所以你们也必须知道苦痛。
倘若你能使你的心时常赞叹日常生活的神妙，你的苦痛的神妙必不减于你的欢乐；
你要承受你心天的季候，如同你常常承受从田里予上度过的四时。
你要静守，度过你心里凄凉的冬日。
许多的苦痛是你自择的。
那是你身中的医士，医治你病躯的苦药。
所以你要信托这医生，静默安宁地吃他的药：
因为他的手腕虽重而辣，却是有冥冥的温柔之手指导着。
他带来的药杯，虽会焚灼你的嘴唇，那陶土却是陶工用他自己神圣的眼泪来润湿调抟而成的。
16
On Pain
And a woman spoke, saying, "Tell us of Pain."
And he said:
Your pain is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.
Even as the stone of the fruit must break, that its heart may stand in the sun, so must you know pain.
And could you keep your heart in wonder at the daily miracles of your life, your pain would not seem less wondrous than your joy;
And you would accept the seasons of your heart, even as you have always accepted the seasons that pass over your fields.
And you would watch with serenity through the winters of your grief.
Much of your pain is self-chosen.
It is the bitter potion by which the physician within you heals your sick self.
Therefore trust the physician, and drink his remedy in silence and tranquillity:
For his hand, though heavy and hard, is guided by the tender hand of the Unseen,
And the cup he brings, though it burn your lips, has been fashioned of the clay which the Potter has moistened with His own sacred tears.

[book_title]自知
于是一个男人说，请给我们讲自知。
他回答说：
在宁静中，你的心知道了白日和黑夜的奥秘。
但你的耳朵渴求听到你心的知识的声音。
你愿在意念中所了解的，能从语言中知道。
你愿能用手指去抚触你的赤裸的梦魂。
你要这样做是好的。
你的心灵隐秘的涌泉，必须升溢，吟唱着奔向大海；
你的无穷深处的宝藏，必须在你目前呈现。
但不要用秤来衡量你的未知的珍宝，
也不要用杖竿和响带去探测你的知识的浅深。
因为自我乃是一片无边无际的海。
不要说“我找到了真理”，只要说“我找到了一条真理”。
不要说“我找到了灵魂的道路”，只要说“我遇见了灵魂在我的道路上行走。”
因为灵魂在一切的道路上行走。
灵魂不只在一条道路上行走，也不是芦草似的生长。
灵魂如同一朵千瓣的莲花，自己开放着。
17
On Self-Knowledge
And a man said, "Speak to us of Self-Knowledge."
And he answered, saying:
Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.
But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.
You would know in words that which you have always know in thought.
You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.
And it is well you should.
The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea;
And the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.
But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;
And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.
For self is a sea boundless and measureless.
Say not, "I have found the truth," but rather, "I have found a truth."
Say not, "I have found the path of the soul."
Say rather, "I have met the soul walking upon my path."
For the soul walks upon all paths.
The soul walks not upon a line, neither does it grow like a reed.
The soul unfolds itself, like a lotus of countless petals.
■　从工作里爱了生命，就是贯彻了生命最深的秘密。
■　当智慧骄傲到不肯哭泣，庄严到不肯欢乐，自满到不肯看人的时候，就不成为智慧了。

[book_title]教授
于是一位教师说，请给我们讲教授。
他说：
除了那已经半睡着，躺卧在你知识的晓光里的东西之外，没有人能向你启示什么。
那在殿宇的阴影里，在弟子群中散步的教师，他不是在传授他的智慧，而是在传授他的忠信与仁慈。
假如他真是大智，他就不命令你进入他的智慧之堂，却要引导你到你自己心灵的门口。
天文家能给你讲述他对于太空的了解，他却不能把他的了解给你。
音乐家能给你唱出那充满太空的韵调，他却不能给你那聆受韵调的耳朵和应和韵调的声音。
精通数学的人能说出度量衡的方位，他却不能引导你到那方位上去。
因为一个人不能把他理想的翅翼借给别人。
正如上帝对于你们每个人的了解都是不相同的，所以你们对于上帝和大地的见解也应当是不相同的。

On Teaching
Then said a teacher, "Speak to us of Teaching."
