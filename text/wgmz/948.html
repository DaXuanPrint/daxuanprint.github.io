[book_title]译者序：历经时光淘洗而不衰的处世经典
一
在许多欧洲学者眼里，人类思想史上具有永恒价值的处世智慧包含于三大奇书之中：一是马基雅维里的《君主论》，二是孙武的《孙子兵法》，三就是葛拉西安的《智慧书》。《君主论》主要是为那些处心积虑想取得或保有王权的帝王而写；《孙子兵法》则主要为那些运筹于帷幄之中的将帅而写，而《智慧书》呢，却是为每一个人为人处世、安身立命而写。
如果单从处世智慧来看，《智慧书》则是三本奇书中最微妙、最具实用价值的一本。德国大哲学家叔本华曾刻意将《智慧书》译成德文，并盛赞此书“绝对的独一无二”。尼采也赞扬此书在论述道德的奥妙方面，整个欧洲也没有一本书比它更精微、更曲折多姿；他在一则札记中写道：“葛拉西安的人生经验显示出今日无人能比的智慧与颖悟。”
二
《智慧书》的作者巴尔塔沙·葛拉西安（Baltasar Gracián）是17世纪西班牙思想家、哲学家，也是一位满怀入世热忱的耶稣会教士，他的一生充满了坎坷。葛拉西安于1601年生于西班牙阿拉贡的贝尔蒙特村，1619年进入耶稣会见习修行，此后历任军中神父、告解神父、宣教师、教授及行政人员。虽未曾担任要职，但常与公职人员及贤达人士交往，善于察言观行，因而获得其格言警句之灵感。1636年，其处女作《英雄》问世，旋即引起轰动；1647年，其经典之作《智慧书》出版，掀起了更大的波澜！
葛拉西安因笔锋犀利、讥讽政治，被耶稣会警告，未获批准不得出版作品。1651年，葛拉西安开始以寓言小说形式探讨人生，以纯朴的田园生活反衬文明社会中的邪恶，讽刺巨作《批评家》问世。为此，他被耶稣会解除了教席，放逐至一乡下小镇，受人监视，直至1658年终老于此。
在随后的几百年间，葛拉西安的多部作品被人模仿，并被翻译成各种文字，风行全球，经久不衰。他的思想对伏尔泰和高乃依等在内的许多欧洲著名道德伦理学家，以及德国17—18世纪的宫廷文学、19世纪的哲学都产生过重要的影响。
三
《智慧书》是葛拉西安的巅峰之作，汇集300则妙言警句，浓缩人生处世智慧之精华，可谓则则精辟、字字珠玑，充满了无价的生活智慧和修成智慧实际可行的法门。
在书中，作者以一种令人惊异的冷峻态度，对世俗的道德进行了深刻的反思，对于真相与表象、自私与友爱、机智与傲慢等，都提出了锐利的分析和实用的建议；为世人提供了识人观事、慎断是非、修炼自我、防范邪恶等处世智慧和谋略。通过这些睿智精妙的人生格言，读者不仅可获得克服生活困境的良方，更重要的是可增强对生活的理解和洞察力。阅读此书，一方面使我们叹服作者智慧的审慎态度，另一方面又使我们产生向善的心理。
《智慧书》行文简洁，立意遣词机趣多端，处处蕴藏智慧，读者须慢嚼细咽，仔细揣摩，每次只取一二句格言流连玩味，终致有所助益。
四
本书已有七种英译本，在国外被多家出版社反复重印。马德里皇家历史学院通讯院士约瑟夫·雅各布斯（Joseph Jacobs）将其译为The Art of Worldly Wisdom。该译本文字洗练优美，最忠实地传达了原著者的思想观点，最完美地体现了原著的行文风格，在英语世界具有广泛的影响。此次推出英汉对照版，旨在兼供英语爱好者对照阅读，取一举两得之妙。

[book_title]1．万物已近极致
万物已近极致，为人处世的艺术更是如此。当今若想成就一位智者，花费的工夫比造就希腊七贤(1)还要多；现在要应付一个人，所需的智谋比从前应付整整一个民族还要多。
1．Everything is at its acme
Everything is at its acme, especially the art of making one's way in the world. There is more required nowadays to make a single wise man than formerly to make Seven Sages, and more is needed nowadays to deal with a single person than was required with a whole people in former times.
(1) 指公元前6世纪希腊的Solon、Thales、Pittacus、Bias、Chilo、Periander和Cleobulus。

[book_title]2．品性与智慧
品性与智慧，是组成人类才能的两个要素。要走向幸福生活，缺少哪一个都将半途而废。仅仅拥有智慧是不够的，还要有好的品性。蠢人的不幸，在于没有获得适合他的地位、职业、邻居与朋友圈子。
2．Character and intellect
Character and intellect: the two poles of our capacity; one without the other is but halfway to happiness. Intellect does not suffice, character is also needed. On the other hand, it is the fool's misfortune, to fail in obtaining the position, the employment, the neighbourhood, and the circle of friends that suit him.

[book_title]3．做事时常留有悬念
做事时常留有悬念。若你的成功出人意料，则更能受到钦佩。任何事若昭然若揭，既毫无用处，又让人感到索然无味。若不急于公开自己所做之事，就会使人期待。若你地位显赫，将更能引人注目。将任何事都染上一层神秘的色彩，正是神秘引起尊崇。即便是阐明情况，也不要过于直白，就像在日常交往中不会暴露自己真实的想法一样。谨慎地保持沉默是世间智慧之精髓。公开声明的决心从不会获得高的评价，只给他人的品头论足留下口实。若所行之事恰巧以失败收场，你就会遭受双重的打击。若想引人惊奇与注意，就向那些缄默的神灵学习吧。
3．Keep matters for a time in suspense
Keep matters for a time in suspense. Admiration at their novelty heightens the value of your achievements. It is both useless and insipid to play with the cards on the table. If you do not declare yourself immediately, you arouse expectation, especially when the importance of your position makes you the object of general attention. Mix a little mystery with everything, and the very mystery arouses veneration. And when you explain, be not too explicit, just as you do not expose your inmost thoughts in ordinary intercourse. Cautious silence is the holy of holies of worldly wisdom. A resolution declared is never highly thought of; it only leaves room for criticism. And if it happens to fail, you are doubly unfortunate. Besides you imitate the Divine way when you cause men to wonder and watch.

[book_title]4．有识亦应有胆
有识亦应有胆，这是成为伟人的要素。知识与勇气是不朽的，同样可使人不朽。懂得多少，便有多伟大；若你学识渊博，则无事不可为。一个人无知，正如世界没有光明。智慧与力量，就像双眼与双手。有识无胆者亦无所成。
4．Knowledge and courage
Knowledge and courage are the elements of Greatness. They give immortality, because they are immortal. Each is as much as he knows, and the wise can do anything. A man without knowledge, a world without light. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile.

[book_title]5．让别人依赖你
让别人依赖你。神之所以为神，不在于人们装饰其雕像，而在于人们诚心诚意地崇拜他。智者宁愿他人时刻需要自己，而非感激自己。保持他人的希求是智慧的，期望别人的感激是愚蠢的；期盼让人牢记，而感激使人忘却。受人依赖，比受人恭敬更有益。人解了渴之后，往往转身离开井边；橘子一旦榨干，便会被人从金盘子中扔到垃圾筐里。当人们对你的依赖消失，良好的品行和尊敬也会随着消失。努力保持人们对你的渴求之心，且不使其得到完全满足，这是最重要的人生经验之一。此法让你变得不可或缺，甚至连王座上的君主也永远需要你。但是不要做得太过分，以免误入歧途，也不要为了一己之私而让别人陷入病入膏肓的绝境。
5．Create a feeling of dependence
Create a feeling of dependence. Not he that adorns but he that adores makes a divinity. The wise man would rather see men needing him than thanking him. To keep them on the threshold of hope is diplomatic, to trust to their gratitude boorish; hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy. He that has satisfied his thirst turns his back on the well, and the orange once sucked falls from the golden platter into the waste-basket. When dependence disappears, good behaviour goes with it as well as respect. Let it be one of the chief lessons of experience to keep hope alive without entirely satisfying it, by preserving it to make oneself always needed even by a patron on the throne. But let not silence be carried to excess lest you go wrong, nor let another's failing grow incurable for the sake of your own advantage.

[book_title]6．至善至美的境界
至善至美的境界。我们并非天生完美之人，因此应日求渐进，做到德业兼修，直至尽善尽美，禀赋圆成，成就非凡。完美与否，如何判断？这正是大家所常说的：品味是否纯正，头脑是否清醒，判断是否成熟，意志是否坚定。有些人从来达不到至善的境界，总是有所欠缺；另外一些人则大器晚成。完美的人，言辞中透出智慧，行事谨慎小心，会使贤达之人乐于与之为伍，甚至追随。
6．A man at his highest point
A man at his highest point. We are not born perfect: every day we develop in our personality and in our calling till we reach the highest point of our completed being, to the full round of our accomplishments, of our excellences. This is known by the purity of our taste, the clearness of our thought, the maturity of our judgment, and the firmness of our will. Some never arrive at being complete, somewhat is always awanting; others ripen late. The complete man, wise in speech, prudent in act, is admitted to the familiar intimacy of discreet persons, is even sought for by them.

[book_title]7．不要比上司更耀眼
不要比上司更耀眼。所有的成功都会引起嫉恨，若超过上司，更是愚蠢，甚至是致命的。优越者总是引起他人的憎恨，更别说超过位高权重之人。人要善于将自己的优势深藏不露。举个例子，姣好的面容可以用不经意的装束来遮掩。也许有人不在乎你有好的运气或是温良的秉性，但是没人会乐意——尤其是君主——你在判断力上超过他，因为优秀的判断力是王者特有的能力，你一定要僭越，便是对其不敬。身为君主，自然希望在判断力这一最高贵之特质上远胜一筹。他们可以允许旁人辅佐，却不允许有人超越；要让他们采纳建议，就要像是帮他们回想起忘掉的东西，而不是指引他们去找其久寻不得之物。天上的星辰教会了我们这种愉快的处世策略：它们是太阳之子，并且与太阳一样光亮，却从不与太阳争辉。
7．Avoid victories over superiors
Avoid victories over superiors. All victories breed hate, and that over your superior is foolish or fatal. Superiority is always detested, let alone superiority over superiority Caution can gloss over common advantages; for example, good looks may be cloaked by careless attire. There are some that will grant you precedence in good luck or good temper, but none in good sense, least of all a prince; for good sense is a royal prerogative, any claim of superiority in that is a crime against majesty. They are princes, and wish to be so in that most princely of qualities. They will allow a man to help them but not to surpass them, and will have any advice tendered them appear like a recollection of something they have forgotten rather than as a guide to something they cannot find. The stars teach us this finesse with happy tact: though they are his children and brilliant like him, they never rival the brilliancy of the sun.

[book_title]8．不被激情左右
不被激情左右。这是最优秀的头脑才有的品质。这种优良品质使人免受短暂而低俗的冲动影响。没有什么驾驭能高于驾驭自身及自身之冲动——这是一种意志上的胜利。即便激情控制了你的脾气，也不要让它威胁你的地位；如果地位不低，你更需注意。这是避免丑闻的唯一坦途，也是重获荣誉的最短路径。
8．To be without passions
To be without passions. It is a privilege of the highest order of mind. Their very eminence redeems them from being affected by transient and low impulses. There is no higher rule than that over oneself, over one's impulses: there is the triumph of free will. While passion rules the character, do not let it threaten your position, especially if it is a high one. It is the only refined way of avoiding scandals; nay, it is the shortest way back to good repute.

[book_title]9．避免土生土长的缺陷
避免土生土长的缺陷。水流之品质受河床土质之好坏的影响，人之品性受出生之气候优劣的影响。有些人会比别人更受故乡的恩泽，因为那里更为天清气爽。任何国家（即便是最文明的国家）都有其独特的缺陷——正是这些缺陷，让别的国家聊以自慰或是小心防范。纠正自己的缺陷，或甚至隐藏起这些缺陷，是最明智的胜利。你在同胞中鹤立鸡群，就会赢得好的声誉，出人意料的成功总是更受钦佩。其他的缺陷则源自家庭、职位、职业和所处的时代。如果所有这些缺陷都体现在一个人身上，并且未被小心约束，那定会让他成为无法忍受的怪物。
9．Avoid the faults of your nation
Avoid the faults of your nation. Water shares the good or bad qualities of the strata through which it flows, and men those of the climate in which they are born. Some owe more than others to their native land, because there is a more favourable sky in the zenith. There is not a nation even among the most civilized that has not some fault peculiar to itself which other nations blame by way of boast or as a warning. It is a triumph of cleverness to correct in oneself such national failings, or even to hide them: you get great credit for being unique among your fellows, and as it is less expected of you it is esteemed the more. There are also family failings as well as faults of position, of office or of age. If these all meet in one person and are not carefully guarded against, they make an intolerable monster.

[book_title]10．财富与名望
财富与名望。一个变化无常，一个永恒持久。财富是为了今生，名望是为了来世。得利要防人嫉妒，得名要防人遗忘。人都渴求财运，有时也能达成愿望；名气则是努力挣来的。对名声的渴望源自美德。从古至今，名望总与巨人相伴，且往往会使人走向两种极端——要么成为可恶的魔鬼，要么成为卓越的天才。
10．Fortune and fame
Fortune and fame. Where the one is fickle the other is enduring. The first for life, the second afterwards; the one against envy, the other against oblivion. Fortune is desired, at times assisted; fame is earned. The desire for fame springs from man's best part. Fame was and is the sister of the giants; it always goes to extremes－horrible monsters or brilliant prodigies.

[book_title]11．择师而交
择师而交。让友好的交流成为增长知识之渠道，从谈话中受到教益。这样便使朋友成为你的老师，将交流之乐趣与学习之好处融合在一起。明智的人享受交流的乐趣：发表言论赢得掌声，倾听谈话获得教益。我们通常会因私利而被他人吸引，但这也利于我们达到更高境界。贤达之人常常拜访高贵之人的处所，是将其作为良好修养的舞台，而非名利场。那里总有人因明智的处世智慧而闻名，不只是因为他们以身作则而成为杰出的智者，还因那些与之为伍的人构成了学习精妙处世哲学的儒雅社团。
11．Cultivate those who can teach you
Cultivate those who can teach you. Let friendly intercourse be a school of knowledge, and culture be taught through conversation: thus you make your friends your teachers and mingle the pleasures of conversation with the advantages of instruction. Sensible persons thus enjoy alternating pleasures: they reap applause for what they say, and gain instruction from what they hear. We are always attracted to others by our own interest, but in this case it is of a higher kind. Wise men frequent the houses of great noblemen not because they are temples of vanity, but as theatres of good breeding. There are gentlemen who have the credit of worldly wisdom, because they are not only themselves oracles of all nobleness by their example and their behaviour, but those who surround them form a well-bred academy of worldly wisdom of the best and noblest kind.

[book_title]12．自然和人工：原料与加工
自然和人工：原料与加工。世上没有未经修饰的美；若无人工修饰，优点都将变得粗俗。人工技巧可弥补短处，提升长处。天生之物很少完美，因此我们必须求助人工技术。若无陶冶，最好的秉性也会变得毫无教养；若无培养，任何天赋都将折损一半。若无人为的修炼，任何人都有不够完美的一面；任何优点都需要打磨。
12．Nature and art
Nature and art: material and workmanship. There is no beauty unadorned and no excellence that would not become barbaric if it were not supported by artifice: this remedies the evil and improves the good. Nature scarcely ever gives us the very best; for that we must have recourse to art. Without this the best of natural dispositions is uncultured, and half is lacking to any excellence if training is absent. Every one has something unpolished without artificial training, and every kind of excellence needs some polish.

[book_title]13．有时三思而行，有时立下决断
13．有时三思而行，有时立下决断
有时三思而行，有时立下决断。生活就是一场与邪恶的战争。睿智的斗争伴随着意图的战略性改变——恐吓是假，声东击西。他总是隐藏自己的意图，先是老练地虚晃一枪，然后出其不意地猛击对方要害。他透露出一个意图，只是为了吸引对方的注意力，然后再伺机出奇制胜。但是，明智的人可以警惕地预料到这一招，然后隐藏起来——明智者总能看清对手希望自己了解的情况之反面，看破对方每个虚招诡计。他会放过第一次出击，等待第二个时机，甚至第三次出击的机会。当狡诈者发现自己的阴谋被人识破，就会使出更高的招数：改变策略，以改变欺诈，想要用真相本身来蒙蔽，用不欺骗来达到欺骗的目的，把欺骗建立在最大程度的坦诚上。但是，明智者更会警觉起来，发现其光明外表下暗藏的阴谋诡计，解读其每个行动的真实含义，对方外表越单纯，可能心计越狡诈。蟒蛇怪皮同(1)用阴谋诡计与阿波罗的明光相斗时的情况正是如此。
13．Act sometimes on second thoughts, sometimes on first impulse
Act sometimes on second thoughts, sometimes on first impulse. Man's life is a warfare against the malice of others. Sagacity fights with strategic changes of intention: it never does what it threatens, it aims only at escaping notice. It aims in the air with dexterity and strikes home in an unexpected direction, always seeking to conceal its game. It lets a purpose appear in order to attract the opponent's attention, but then turns round and conquers by the unexpected. But a penetrating intelligence anticipates this by watchfulness and lurks in ambush. It always understands the opposite of what the opponent wishes it to understand, and recognizes every feint of guile. It lets the first impulse pass by and waits for the second, or even the third. Sagacity now rises to higher flights on seeing its artifice foreseen, and tries to deceive by truth itself, changes its game in order to change its deceit, and cheats by not cheating, and founds deception on the greatest candour. But the opposing intelligence is on guard with increased watchfulness, and discovers the darkness concealed by the light and deciphers every move, the more subtle because more simple. In this way the guile of the Python combats the far darting rays of Apollo.
(1)是古希腊神话中大地女神盖亚之子，代表黑暗，后被阿波罗用弓箭和火炬杀死。

[book_title]14．事物本身及做事的方法
事物本身及做事的方法。只注意事物本身还不够，还需注意做事的方法。坏的方式会毁掉所有事情——哪怕你是有道理的和正义的；好的做事方式可对事情有所补益，可让“拒绝”冠冕堂皇，让真相更喜闻乐见，甚至让苍老的面孔增色一点。如何做事，至关重要。礼节可获得人们好感。良好的风度给生活增添乐趣，令人愉快的表达助你轻松地摆脱困境。
14．The thing itself and the way it is done
The thing itself and the way it is done. Substance is not enough, attention to circumstance is also required, as the scholastics say. A bad manner spoils everything, even reason and justice; a good one supplies everything, gilds a No, sweetens truth, and adds a touch of beauty to old age itself. The how plays a large part in affairs, a good manner steals into the affections. Fine behaviour is a joy in life, and a pleasant expression helps out of a difficulty in a remarkable way.

[book_title]15．广纳贤人
广纳贤人。手握强权的人有一项特权，即网罗足智多谋之才，以摆脱无知的恐惧，助其解决难题。极少数伟人明白如何充分利用这些谋士，这比提戈涅斯(1)的粗野趣味要远胜一筹，他喜欢让被俘的君王做自己的奴仆。这是人生中最好且最新奇的驭人之术——从禀赋来说，他们可做我们的主人，却成为我们的仆人，为我所用。知无涯，而生有涯：没有知识的生活就不是真正的生活。若够聪明，你可学有所成而不费吹灰之力——只需博采众长，便可成为集大成者。之后，当你代表大家在议事厅发言时，你之前请教过多少智者，就等于有多少智者在借你的口说话，于是，你便可借他人之力获大智之名。这些贤达人士提炼最好的书籍，提供智慧的精华。如果不能让圣贤为你服务，也要与之为友。
15．Keep ministering spirits
Keep ministering spirits. It is a privilege of the mighty to surround themselves with the champions of intellect; these extricate them from every fear of ignorance, these worry out for them the moot points of every difficulty. It is a rare greatness to make use of the wise, and far exceeds the barbarous taste of Tigranes, who had a fancy for captive monarchs as his servants. It is a novel kind of supremacy, the best that life can offer, to have as servants by skill those who by nature are our masters. It is a great thing to know, little to live: no real life without knowledge. There is remarkable cleverness in studying without study, in getting much by means of many, and through them all to become wise. Afterwards you speak in the council chamber on behalf of many, and as many sages speak through your mouth as were consulted beforehand: you thus obtain the fame of an oracle by others' toil. Such ministering spirits distil the best books and serve up the quintessence of wisdom. But he that cannot have sages in service should have them for his friends.
(1) 指公元前1世纪的亚美尼亚君王，出行时喜用被俘君王做随从。

[book_title]16．学识和善心
学识和善心结合起来可确保成就不断。高超的智慧与邪恶的意愿相结合，会生出变态的魔怪。邪恶的意愿将破坏所有的优点；如果再有学识助力，将使事情更加败坏。这是一种可悲的过人之处，它的最终结果就是毁灭。有学识而无明智的判断，则倍加愚蠢。
16．Knowledge and good intentions
Knowledge and good intentions together ensure continuance of success. A fine intellect wedded to a wicked will was always an unnatural monster. A wicked will envenoms all excellences: helped by knowledge it only ruins with greater subtlety. It is a miserable superiority that only results in ruin. Knowledge without sense is double folly.

[book_title]17．变换你的行为模式
变换你的行为模式，不要一直用同一种方式处理问题，以分散别人的注意力，有竞争对手时，更是如此。不要总是根据第一反应做事，人们会很快记住你这种一成不变的风格，并可预想到你的下一步，挫败你的计划。一只直飞的鸟很容易被捕杀；而迂回飞翔的小鸟则不易被抓到。最好也不要按照第二种想法做事，那样人们也极易洞悉你的计划。敌人一直在观察你，你要有过人的本领，以智取胜。赌徒从不打出对手可预料到的牌，更不会打出对手想要的牌。
17．Vary the mode of action
Vary the mode of action; not always the same way, so as to distract attention, especially if there be a rival. Not always from first impulse; people will soon recognize the uniformity, and by anticipating, frustrate your designs. It is easy to kill a bird on the wing that flies straight: not so one that twists. Nor always act on second thoughts: people can discern the plan the second time. The enemy is on the watch, great skill is required to circumvent him. The gamester never plays the card the opponent expects, still less that which he wants.

[book_title]18．努力和能力
努力和能力。缺少两者，就不可能出类拔萃，如果二者兼而有之，定会卓尔不群。努力的平凡者比不努力的聪明人更有所成。工作是赢得荣誉的代价。付出少价值就低。即使是身居高位，所缺的往往是实干，很少是才能。宁愿在伟大的事业上取得普通成就，也不想在低级职位上出类拔萃，这本也无可厚非；如果你本是天才，却甘于平庸，则毫无道理。天赋与后天努力都不可或缺，付出努力方可大功告成。
18．Application and ability
Application and ability. There is no attaining eminence without both, and where they unite there is the greatest eminence. Mediocrity obtains more with application than superiority without it. Work is the price which is paid for reputation. What costs little is little worth. Even for the highest posts it is only in some cases application that is wanting, rarely the talent. To prefer moderate success in great things than eminence in a humble post has the excuse of a generous mind, but not so to be content with humble mediocrity when you could shine among the highest. Thus nature and art are both needed, and application sets on them the seal.

[book_title]19．事前不要让人期望过高
事前不要让人期望过高。名人常见的不幸，便是盛名之下其实难副。事实永远无法满足想象，因为理想容易树立，实现则很难。想象与希望结合，将孕育出更多与事实相距甚远的东西。无论结果多么出色，都无法满足人们的期望。当过高的期望落空，失望随之而来，人们更易心生幻灭，而非佩服。人们心中的希望能极大地扭曲真相，你要有防备这一点的能力，确保所得成果超过希望。刚开始，少许的成功足以唤起人们的好奇心，不必再去信誓旦旦承诺达到什么成功的目标。要让实际超过预计，让结果好过预想。但这个法则不适用于糟糕的事情，夸大坏的程度对之反而起到很大的帮助——对坏处的夸张失实之后会让人们欢呼，因为起初看上去具有毁灭性的事物，到最后竟然变得完全能够承受。
19．Arouse no exaggerated expectations on entering
Arouse no exaggerated expectations on entering. It is the usual ill-luck of all celebrities not to fulfil afterwards the expectations beforehand formed of them. The real can never equal the imagined, for it is easy to form ideals but very difficult to realize them. Imagination weds Hope and gives birth to much more than things are in themselves. However great the excellences, they never suffice to fulfil expectations, and as men find themselves disappointed with their exorbitant expectations they are more ready to be disillusionized than to admire. Hope is a great falsifier of truth; let skill guard against this by ensuring that fruition exceeds desire. A few creditable attempts at the beginning are sufficient to arouse curiosity without pledging one to the final object. It is better that reality should surpass the design and is better than was thought. This rule does not apply to the wicked things, for the same exaggeration is a great aid to them; they are defeated amid general applause, and what seemed at first extreme ruin comes to be thought quite bearable.

[book_title]20．生逢其时的人
生逢其时的人。最珍稀的人总是有赖于他们所处的时代。不是每个人都能生而逢时；即便是生而逢时，也未必能把握时机。有些人本应生在更美好的年代，因为善良之人并非无往而不胜。万物都有自己的时代，就连优秀的品质也要看它是否跟得上潮流。智者的一个优势在于：智者不朽。哪怕现在不得志，今后也定会流芳百世。
20．A man of the age
A man of the age. The rarest individuals depend on their age. It is not every one that finds the age he deserves, and even when he finds it he does not always know how to utilize it. Some men have been worthy of a better century, for every species of good does not always triumph. Things have their period; even excellences are subject to fashion. The sage has one advantage: he is immortal. If this is not his century many others will be.

[book_title]21．幸运之道
幸运之道。幸运自有规律：智者不会只靠运气，运气可以小心维护。有些人满足于徘徊在幸运的机会大门前，期望幸运女神将其打开。有些人做得更好，他们凭借自己的胆大心细，奋勇向前，亲近幸运女神，用美德与英勇的翅膀赢得她的喜爱，进而获益。但是，从真正的人生观来讲，美德与见识才是真正的评判官，因为世上没有幸与不幸之别，只有聪明与愚蠢之分。
21．The art of being lucky
The art of being lucky. There are rules of luck: it is not all chance with the wise; it can be assisted by care. Some content themselves with placing them selves confidently at the gate of Fortune, waiting till she opens it. Others do better, and press forward and profit by their clever boldness, reaching the goddess and winning her favour on the wings of their virtue and valor. But on a true philosophy there is no other umpire than virtue and insight, for there is no luck or ill-luck except wisdom and the reverse.

[book_title]22．学以致用
学以致用。智者用高尚的品味和博雅的学识武装自己——此乃经世致用的学问，而非市井杂谈。他们具备广博的智慧妙语，懂得大量的丰功伟绩，并且深知如何在各种情况下加以运用。通常情况下，用俏皮话的方式阐释严肃的教义更有益。灵活实用的知识比七艺(1)更有帮助，不管七艺有多么雅致。
22．A man of knowledge to the point
A man of knowledge to the point. Wise men arm themselves with tasteful and elegant erudition: a practical knowledge of what is going on not of a common kind but more like an expert. They possess a copious store of wise and witty sayings, and of noble deeds, and know how to employ them on fitting occasions. More is often taught by a jest than by the most serious teaching. Pat knowledge helps some more than the seven arts, be they ever so liberal.
(1) 指中世纪欧洲大学常设的七门学科：语法、修辞、逻辑、算术、几何、音乐和天文。

[book_title]23．没有瑕疵
没有瑕疵。这是完美所必要达到的境界。任何人都会有缺点，无论是身体上还是精神上。尽管很容易克服，人们却听之任之。杰出人士身上的缺陷，总会让目光敏锐的人感到遗憾——要知道，一小片乌云便足以遮掩整个太阳的光辉。在我们的名誉方面，也有类似瑕疵，居心不良者一眼就能看到，且会不断发难。最好的方法是把瑕疵当作装饰，所以恺撒曾用桂冠隐藏起自己秃头的缺陷。
23．Be spotless
Be spotless: the indispensable condition of perfection. Few live without some weak point, either physical or moral, which they pamper because they could easily cure it. The keenness of others often regrets to see a slight defect attaching itself to a whole assembly of elevated qualities, and yet a single cloud can hide the whole of the sun. There are likewise patches on our reputation which ill-will soon finds out and is continually noticing. The highest skill is to transform them into ornament. So Caesar hid his natural defects with the laurel.

[book_title]24．控制自己的幻想
控制自己的幻想。有时你必须纠正幻想，有时你要促进幻想。这件事关系到我们是否幸福、是否理智。人的幻想可能横行霸道，并不满足于冷眼旁观，而会影响并统治我们的生活。幻想能带给我们欢乐，也会成为我们的负担。这取决于它将我们引向何种荒谬。它可让我们知足，也会让我们对自己不满。对某些人来说，幻想是不断的惩罚，是让愚蠢之人苦修的鞭带；对另一些人来说，幻想以快乐的错觉来承诺幸福和奇遇。它什么都能做，除非你能通过最谨慎的克制，而成为它的主人。
24．Keep the imagination under control
Keep the imagination under control; sometimes correcting, sometimes assisting it. For it is all-important for our happiness, and even sets the reason right. It can tyrannize, and is not content with looking on, but influences and even often dominates life, causing it to be happy or burdensome according to the folly to which it leads. For it makes us either contented or discontented with ourselves. Before some it continually holds up the penalties of action, and becomes the mortifying lash of these fools. To others it promises happiness and adventure with blissful delusion. It can do all this unless the most prudent self-control keeps it in subjection.

[book_title]25．善于领会弦外之音
善于领会弦外之音。善谈曾是人首先要掌握的技巧，但此术已不敷用。我们必须懂得领悟暗示，尤其是用于解除自己的疑惑。若不能很好地理解别人，那就很难被别人理解。有的人就像极善揣测他人之心的术士、洞察猎物之意的山猫。恰恰是那些对我们极为重要的真相，别人只会说一半。但是，只要用心，我们就能够理解全部含义。好事宁信其无，坏事宁信其有。
25．Know how to take a hint
Know how to take a hint. It was once the art of arts to be able to discourse; now it is no longer sufficient. We must know how to take a hint, especially in disabusing ourselves. He cannot make himself understood who does not himself easily understand. But on the other hand there are pretended diviners of the heart and lynxes of the intentions. The very truths which concern us most can only be half spoken, but with attention we can grasp the whole meaning. When you hear anything favourable keep a tight rein on your credulity; if unfavourable, give it the spur.

[book_title]26．揪出他人的把柄
揪出他人的把柄。这是控制他人意志的艺术。与其说需要决心，毋宁说需要技巧。你必须懂得如何着手。每一决断都有其特定的动机，并随个人品味之异而异。所有人都有崇拜情结：重名、重利，或者如多数人那样，重个人愉悦。控制人们的诀窍是：明了他们的崇拜物是什么，从而牵着他们的鼻子走。掌握某人行事的主要动机，就等于拥有了开启其欲望之门的钥匙。你所需寻找的初始动机，并非总是人性中最高尚的部分，更多时候，它常常是人性中最卑下的东西，因为世人秉性不良者比秉性良善者要多。揣测一个人的主要兴趣，以言语要求他，以诱惑促其行动，他必为你所用。
26．Find out each man's thumbscrew
Find out each man's thumbscrew. It is the art of setting their wills in action. It needs more skill than resolution. You must know where to get at any one. Every volition has a special motive which varies according to taste. All men are idolaters, some of fame, others of self-interest, most of pleasure. Skill consists in knowing these idols in order to bring them into play. Knowing any man's mainspring of motive you have as it were the key to his will. Have resort to primary motors, which are not always the highest but more often the lowest part of his nature: there are more dispositions badly organized than well. First guess a man's ruling passion, appeal to it by a word, set it in motion by temptation, and you will infallibly give checkmate to his freedom of will.

[book_title]27．求精深重于求广博
求精深重于求广博。优秀在质，而非量。最好的事物往往十分稀有——物以稀为贵。人亦如此，往往巨人也是侏儒。某些书以其形式厚重而获得人们的赞誉，似乎此书是要锻炼臂力而非智力。只有广博决不能超越平庸，那些可怜的所谓通才总是试图门门精通，却总是样样不通，这是他们的不幸。精深方可卓越。如若专精于要事，则可享誉盛名。
27．Prize intensity more than extent
Prize intensity more than extent. Excellence resides in quality not in quantity. The best is always few and rare: much lowers value. Even among men giants are commonly the real dwarfs. Some reckon books by the thickness, as if they were written to try the brawn more than the brain. Extent alone never rises above mediocrity: it is the misfortune of universal geniuses that in attempting to be at home everywhere, are so nowhere. Intensity gives eminence, and rises to the heroic in matters sublime.

[book_title]28．超凡脱俗
超凡脱俗。首先在品味上，更须脱俗。当你为取悦平庸大众之所为有所不安，说明你尚且伟大而明智。庸俗大众的掌声绝对无法满足智者，但也有投俗取宠的变色龙(1)——他们特喜吞食大众之俗气，而不愿呼吸阿波罗之和煦清风。再者，见识要脱俗。不要以平庸大众的惊叹为乐，因为无知之人只会惊叹。当庸人惊叹之时，智者要谨防受其蒙蔽。
28．Common in nothing
Common in nothing. First, not in taste. O great and wise, to be ill at ease when your deeds please the mob! The excesses of popular applause never satisfy the sensible. There are such chameleons of popularity that they find enjoyment not in the sweet savors of Apollo but in the breath of the mob. Secondly, not in intelligence. Take no pleasure in the wonder of the mob, for ignorance never gets beyond wonder. While vulgar folly wonders wisdom watches for the trick.
(1) 变色龙代表虚荣，古人以为它靠吸风、饮气维生。

[book_title]29．刚直的人
刚直的人坚持正义，不屈不挠，无论是暴民之冲动，抑或是暴君之淫威，都不会令其有失公允。但是，谁能成为这样一个不死鸟式的公正人物呢？追随正义的人屈指可数。确实有许多人赞美这种品德，但只希望别人去实践。有的勇于实践，却往往知难而退；危难当头，伪君子弃之若敝，政客将之改头换面。坚守正义，就不在乎其是否与友谊、权势甚至私利相冲突，所以便有被人抛弃之危险。狡猾之人巧言惑众，大谈所谓为了服从上级，或是为了国家利益。但率直忠贞之人却视其为背信弃义。他们更注重坚贞不屈，而非所谓的精明。这样的人总与真理为伴。若他们抛弃了某一群体，则是因他人背弃了真理，而非他们变化无常。
29．A man of rectitude
A man of rectitude clings to the sect of right with such tenacity of purpose that neither the passions of the mob nor the violence of the tyrant can ever cause him to transgress the bounds of right. But who shall be such a Phoenix of equity? What a scanty following has rectitude! Many praise it indeed, but－for others. Others follow it till danger threatens; then the false deny it, the politic conceal it. For it cares not if it fights with friendship, power, or even self-interest: then comes the danger of desertion. Then astute men make plausible distinctions so as not to stand in the way of their superiors or of reasons of state. But the straightforward and constant regard dissimulation as a kind of treason, and set more store on tenacity than on sagacity. Such are always to be found on the side of truth, and if they desert a party, they do not change from fickleness, but because the others have first deserted truth.

[book_title]30．不做毁誉之事
不做毁誉之事，更不要追随可能带来恶名而不是荣誉的风气。社会上有不少邪门左道，明智的人远离这一切。有些人的品味是很奇怪的，明智之人鄙弃的东西他也能全盘接受。他们酷爱那些奇行怪事，这确实可能让他们家喻户晓，但往往是作为笑柄，而非赞誉。谨慎之人不会公然宣称自己有智慧，更别说去追求那些让自己或是追随者看上去可笑的东西。这种事情无须特指，人们的鄙视已足以指明。
30．Have naught to do with occupations of ill-repute
Have naught to do with occupations of ill-repute, still less with fads that bring more notoriety than repute. There are many fanciful sects, and from all the prudent man has to flee. There are men with bizarre tastes that always take to their heart all that wise men repudiate; they live in love with singularity. This may make them well known indeed, but more as objects of ridicule than of repute. A cautious man does not even make profession of his wisdom, still less of those matters that make him or his followers ridiculous. These need not be specified, for common contempt has sufficiently singled them out.

[book_title]31．学会趋利避害
学会趋利避害。霉运往往是对愚蠢的惩罚，且极易传染。不要以恶小而开门，因为大恶往往会随之而来。玩牌的诀窍是：你应明白自己何时该舍弃某张牌。在过去的一局中，最大的牌也比不上现在最小的王牌。假如你举棋不定，记得结交智慧而审慎的人，他们迟早会赢。
31．Select the lucky and avoid the unlucky
Select the lucky and avoid the unlucky. Ill-luck is generally the penalty of folly, and there is no disease so contagious to those who share in it. Never open the door to a lesser evil, for other and greater ones invariably slink in after it. The greatest skill at cards is to know when to discard; the smallest of current trumps is worth more than the ace of trumps of the last game. When in doubt, follow the suit of the wise and prudent; sooner or later they will win the odd trick.

[book_title]32．因善行而闻名
因善行而闻名。仁德应被位高权重之人引为无上光荣，赢得普天大众之好感是君主才有的特权。做领袖的一大好处是：较其他人更易行善。要结交朋友，就要做好事。但是，有的人却总是很暴虐，不是因为亲善很难，而是因为这种人性情乖戾，凡事他们都喜欢与神圣的仁善背道而驰。
32．Have the reputation of being gracious
Have the reputation of being gracious. It is the chief glory of the high and mighty to be gracious, a prerogative of kings to conquer universal goodwill. That is the great advantage of a commanding position－to be able to do more good than others. Those make friends who do friendly acts. On the other hand, there are some who lay themselves out for not being gracious, not on account of the difficulty, but from a bad disposition. In all things they are the opposite of Divine grace.

[book_title]33．知道如何逃避
知道如何逃避。懂得如何拒绝是人生最重要的一课，其中，更重要的是懂得如何拒绝牵涉某些事与人。那些无关之事只是徒耗宝贵时光。忙于无关之事，还不如什么都不做。对一个谨慎细致的人来说，不仅不干涉他人，还要注意不被他人干涉。别完全属于他人，以免完全失去自己。对于朋友，你不能滥用其帮助，你所求之帮助不能超过他们愿意给你的。过犹不及，人际交往最忌失衡。明智地适可而止，可赢得别人的善意和尊重，用这种方法，别人才会始终对你客客气气。懂得逃避，你才能保住自己的才华，去自由选择最好的东西，而不违背追求高品位的不成文法则。
33．Know how to withdraw
Know how to withdraw. If it is a great lesson in life to know how to deny, it is a still greater to know how to deny oneself as regards both affairs and persons. There are extraneous occupations which eat away precious time. To be occupied in what does not concern you is worse than doing nothing. It is not enough for a careful man not to interfere with others, he must see that they do not interfere with him. One is not obliged to belong so much to all as not to belong at all to oneself. So with friends, their help should not be abused or more demanded from them than they themselves will grant. All excess is a failing, but above all in personal intercourse. A wise moderation in this best preserves the goodwill and esteem of all, for by this means that precious boon of courtesy is not gradually worn away. Thus you preserve your genius free to select the elect, and never sin against the unwritten laws of good taste.

[book_title]34．了解自己的最强项
了解自己的最强项，充分了解自己的天赋，培养它，会有助于其他特长的发展。假如人人都知道自己的长处，那么，人人都能在某一领域有所建树。分辨出自己的天赋属于何种类型，并且加以保护。有人长于判断，有人富有勇气。大部分人都在粗暴地运用自己的天资，结果一无所获。当初只是在热情中迷失，日后醒悟过来，却为时已晚。
34．Know your strongest point
Know your strongest point－ your preeminent gift; cultivate that and you will assist the rest. Everyone would have excelled in something if he had known his strong point. Notice in what quality you surpass, and take charge of that. In some judgment excels, in others valour. Most do violence to their natural aptitude, and thus attain superiority in nothing. Time disillusionizes us too late of what first flattered the passions.

[book_title]35．遇事斟酌，遇要事则更要斟酌
遇事斟酌，遇要事则更要斟酌。蠢人之所以陷入悲伤，皆因其缺乏思考。他们对事物的认识一知半解，因不知其得失，也就不肯全力以赴去做。有的人也思考，可本末倒置，漠视紧要之事，却对鸡毛蒜皮之事小题大做。有的人绝不会失去理智，因为他们根本没有理智。我们要详察一些事情，且铭记于心。智者思索每一件事情，却有所分别，他们尤其注重极艰深之事，总觉得自己很可能思虑不周。如此一来，其所虑之事必为其所知。
35．Think over things, most over the most important
Think over things, most over the most important. All fools come to grief from want of thought. They never see even the half of things, and as they do not observe their own loss or gain, still less do they apply any diligence to them. Some make much of what imports little and little of much, always weighing in the wrong scale. Many never lose their common sense, because they have none to lose. There are matters which should be observed with the closest attention of the mind, and thenceforth kept in its lowest depths. The wise man thinks over everything, but with a difference, most profoundly where there is some profound difficulty, and thinks that perhaps there is more in it than he thinks. Thus his comprehension extends as far as his apprehension.

[book_title]36．进退之际，了解时运
进退之际，了解时运。把握自己的时运比了解自己的脾气秉性更为重要。如果人到四十才向希波克拉底(1)要健康，无疑是愚蠢的；如果这时才知道向塞涅卡(2)要智慧，就更愚蠢了。懂得在等待好运的同时如何引导运气，需要有高超的技巧。有的事只要等待好运便能完成，因为运气是有周期的且能提供机会——尽管它没有规律，难以捉摸。如果受到幸运女神的青睐，你就应大胆向前，因为幸运女神喜欢勇敢的人。作为女性，她也喜欢年轻人。假使你时运不济，你就应撤退，以免一失再失。
36．In acting or refraining, weigh your luck
In acting or refraining, weigh your luck. More depends on that than on noticing your temperament. If he is a fool who at forty applies to Hippocrates for health, still more is he one who then first applies to Seneca for wisdom. It is a great piece of skill to know how to guide your luck even while waiting for it. For something is to be done with it by waiting so as to use it at the proper moment, since it has periods and offers opportunities, though one cannot calculate its path, its steps are so irregular. When you find Fortune favourable, stride boldly forward, for she favours the bold and, being a woman, the young. But if you have bad luck, keep retired so as not to redouble the influence of your unlucky star.

(2) 古罗马政治家、哲学家、演说家、作家，晚期斯多葛派哲学的主要代表人物。

[book_title]37．准备一些讥诮话，并善加利用
准备一些讥诮话，并善加利用。人际交往中，此点最奥妙。有的讥诮话常常用来探测别人的情绪，它往往是刺探人心的最敏锐的试金石。有的话恶毒、粗野，因深染妒忌之气或激情之毒，它猛一出现可立马摧毁所有的好感和尊重。就是被这种话稍稍刺激，许多人和尊长或下属再不亲密——他们原本亲密无间，众人的暗讽和一些人的恶意都不能动摇他们的关系。有的讥诮话可以起到好的作用，巩固和提高人的名望。不管怎样，他人越有奸计，我们越要加倍小心，敏锐且有预见性地把它化解掉。知晓他人的恶意，本身就是一种防备——能够被预见的一击常常打不中目标。
37．Keep a store of sarcasms, and know how to use them
Keep a store of sarcasms, and know how to use them. This is the point of greatest tact in human intercourse. Such sarcasms are often thrown out to test men's moods, and by their means one often obtains the most subtle and penetrating touchstone of the heart. Other sarcasms are malicious, insolent, poisoned by envy or envenomed by passion, unexpected flashes which destroy at once all favour and esteem. Struck by the slightest word of this kind, many fall away from the closest intimacy with superiors or inferiors which could not be the slightest shaken by a whole conspiracy of popular insinuation or private malevolence. Other sarcasms, on the other hand, work favourably, confirming and assisting one's reputation. But the greater the skill with which they are launched, the greater the caution with which they should be received and the foresight with which they should he foreseen. For here a knowledge of the evil is in itself a means of defence, and a shot foreseen always misses its mark.

[book_title]38．急流勇退
急流勇退。所有的高级玩家均长于此道。适时的撤退正如巧妙的进攻。一旦功德圆满，即便还有更多盛名，也要急流勇退。络绎不绝的好运总是十分可疑。断续的好运似乎更安全一些，对于那些喜欢品尝忧喜参半之味的人来说，似乎也更甜美。当好运来得太多太快时，危险也越大，且可能一塌糊涂。有时，幸运女神的青睐虽然很强烈，但是却很短暂。背一个人太久了，她很快就会厌倦的。
38．Leave your luck while winning
Leave your luck while winning. All the best players do it. A fine retreat is as good as a gallant attack. Bring your exploits under cover when there are enough, or even when there are many of them. Luck long lasting was ever suspicious; interrupted seems safer, and is even sweeter to the taste for a little infusion of bitter-sweet. The higher the heap of luck, the greater the risk of a slip, and down comes all. Fortune pays you sometimes for the intensity of her favours by the shortness of their duration. She soon tires of carrying anyone long on her shoulders.

[book_title]39．了解事物成熟的时机，并善加利用
了解事物成熟的时机，并善加利用。万物都有其成熟之时——在此之前它们不断完善，然后逐渐衰退。至于人工之物，则很少能够达到完美的顶点而无需改进。那些高品位的人的特权，就是在事物达到完美之时充分享受它。并非人人都能分辨出这一时刻；即便能够辨别，也未必知道如何享用。智慧的果实也有成熟之时，要善察其时，以便利用它的使用价值和交换价值。
39．Recognize when things are ripe, and then enjoy them
Recognize when things are ripe, and then enjoy them. The works of nature all reach a certain point of maturity; up to that they improve, after that they degenerate. Few works of art reach such a point that they cannot be improved. It is an especial privilege of good taste to enjoy everything at its ripest. Not all can do this, nor do all who can know this. There is a ripening point too for fruits of intellect; it is well to know this both for their value in use and for their value in exchange.

[book_title]40．获得人们的好感
获得人们的好感。获得人们普遍的赞美的确了不起，得到大众的爱戴则更了不起。这既靠天资，也靠后天的努力——前者是基础，后者建立在前者之上。虽然天资被认为是必需的，但是光靠它是不够的。你应该赢得美名，之后要赢得好感就比较容易。要让人们产生好感，你须有善行——既说善话，又更要做善事。如欲被爱，则须先爱人。亲切周到是大人物精明的法宝。先立功德而后立言，先建功而后立传——赢得立言人的好感将使你英名永传。
40．Gain the goodwill of people
Gain the goodwill of people. It is much to gain universal admiration; more, universal love. Something depends on natural disposition, more on practice: the first founds, the second then builds on that foundation. Brilliant parts are not sufficient, though they are presupposed; win good opinion and it is easy to win goodwill. Kindly acts are required to produce kindly feelings, doing good with both hands, good words and better deeds, loving so as to be loved. Courtesy is the politic witchery of great personages. First lay hand on deeds and then on pens; words follow swords; goodwill to be won among writers is eternal.

[book_title]41．切勿言过其实
切勿言过其实。细心谨慎的一个重要目的，就是说话不过分使用“最”字，以免违背事实，或是让人对你的判断力产生怀疑。言过其实糟蹋你的判断力，显得你学识浅薄，品位低劣。赞美之辞引来人们的好奇心，好奇心又滋生欲望。待之后人们发现你是在夸大其词时，期望落空，就会有种被欺骗的感觉，于是滋生报复之心，将赞美者和被赞美者一起贬低下去。因此，谨小慎微之人在评价事物时总是很谨慎，宁可言之不足，也不夸大其词。非凡的事物是很少见的，因此，你要节制你的评价。夸大其词近乎说谎，会危及自身声誉，让人对你的品味产生怀疑；更糟糕的是，让人怀疑你的见识。
41．Never exaggerate
Never exaggerate. It is an important object of attention not to talk in superlatives, so as neither to offend against truth nor to give a mean idea of one's understanding. Exaggeration is a prodigality of the judgment which shows the narrowness of one's knowledge or one's taste. Praise arouses lively curiosity, begets desire, and if afterwards the value does not correspond to the price, as generally happens, expectation revolts against the deception, and revenges itself by under-estimating the thing recommended and the person recommending. A prudent man goes more cautiously to work, and prefers to err by understatement than by overstatement. Extraordinary things are rare, therefore moderate your valuation. Exaggeration is a branch of lying, and you lose by it the credit of good taste, which is much, and of good sense, which is more.

[book_title]42．天生为王
天生为王。这是一种神秘的特异力量，不是来源于技巧，而来自于天生的支配力。人们会不明就里地臣服于此人脚下，拜服于这种权威的神秘力量。这种天生的王者有君王的资质，有如雄狮般的特殊才能。他们使人敬畏、甘心臣服。假如他们还有其他品质，那么他们天生就要成为国家的风云人物。他的一个手势所造成的影响，远胜于别人的长篇大论。
42．Born to command
Born to command. It is a secret force of superiority not to have to get on by artful trickery but by an inborn power of rule. All submit to it without knowing why, recognizing the secret vigour of connatural authority. Such magisterial spirits are kings by merit and lions by innate privilege. By the esteem which they inspire, they hold the hearts and minds of the rest. If their other qualities permit, such men are born to be the prime motors of the state. They perform more by a gesture than others by a long harangue.

[book_title]43．心随精英，口随大众
心随精英，口随大众。逆流而上难以纠正错误，并且危机四伏——只有苏格拉底(1)才敢这么做。与他人唱反调，他人会视为侮辱，因为这相当于你在谴责其判断力。你谴责了某种看法，也就谴责了赞成这种看法的人，因此，你会招致双倍的厌恶。真理属于少数人，谬误恶劣却普遍。你不能根据人们在公众之前所言去判断其是否明智。智者在那里说的话都不是发自内心，只是迎合大众趣味而已，他内心也许对此深恶痛绝。谨慎之人应避免被人反驳，也应尽量不反驳别人——虽然他们老早便已作出评判，却不急于发表。人的思想生而自由，不容亦不应遭到贸然侵犯。智者因此保持缄默，如果他愿意敞开胸怀，也只是在隐蔽之处，在一小部分合适的人面前。
43．Think with the few and speak with the many
Think with the few and speak with the many. By swimming against the stream it is impossible to remove error, easy to fall into danger: only a Socrates can undertake it. To dissent from others' views is regarded as an insult, because it is their condemnation. Disgust is doubled on account of the thing blamed and of the person who praised it. Truth is for the few, error is both common and vulgar. The wise man is not known by what he says on the public square, for there he speaks not with his own voice but with that of common folly, however much his inmost thoughts may gainsay it. The prudent avoid being contradicted as much as contradicting: though they have their censure ready they are not ready to publish it. Thought is free, force cannot and should not be used to it. The wise man therefore retires into silence, and if he allows himself to come out of it, he does so in the shade and before few and fit persons.

[book_title]44．英雄相惜
英雄相惜。与其他英雄惺惺相惜是英雄的特质。可以说，这种特质是人间奇迹，因为它神秘而于人有益。心灵之间有天生的亲缘关系，心灵结合的效果是这样神奇，使得无知俗人将其归结为魔力。产生敬重，进而产生善意，有时，还能产生友爱。它无需言语而使人信服，无须付出而赢得众多。感情上的共鸣分为主动和被动两种，皆能带来相同的幸福。越如此，越令人崇敬。认识、区别并利用这种天赋，是一门伟大的艺术。无论多努力，都无法取代这种造化的眷顾。
44．Sympathy with great minds
Sympathy with great minds. It is an heroic quality to agree with heroes. It is like a miracle of nature for mystery and for use. There is a natural kinship of hearts and minds: its effects are such that vulgar ignorance scents witchcraft. Esteem established, goodwill follows, which at times reaches affection. It persuades without words and obtains without earning. This sympathy is sometimes active, sometimes passive, both alike felicific: the more so, the more sublime. It is a great art to recognize, to distinguish and to utilize this gift. No amount of energy suffices without that favor of nature.

[book_title]45．狡猾可以运用，但不能滥用
狡猾可以运用，但不能滥用。狡猾，不应成为你的嗜好，更不应该用于自夸。所有的计谋都须隐藏，最该隐藏的就是狡猾，人们最痛恨它。世上常有欺骗，因此你须多加留意。但是，你又不能将防人之心示于人，因为它会引起怀疑，招致麻烦，唤醒他人的报复之心，给你带来不可预知的灾难。做事之前考虑再三是十分有益的，没有比这更能证明你有智慧。能否运筹帷幄，决胜千里，全在于手段是否周全。
45．Use, but do not abuse, cunning
Use, but do not abuse, cunning. One ought not to delight in it, still less to boast of it. Everything artificial should be concealed, most of all cunning, which is hated. Deceit is much in use; therefore our caution has to be redoubled, but not so as to show itself, for it arouses distrust, causes much annoy, awakens revenge, and gives rise to more ills than you would imagine. To go to work with caution is of great advantage in action, and there is no greater proof of wisdom. The greatest skill in any deed consists in the sure mastery with which it is executed.

[book_title]46．控制你的反感情绪
控制你的反感情绪。我们总是任凭自己本能地厌恶一些人，即便我们尚未了解他们的情况。有时，这种发自内心的卑劣的厌恶会指向杰出人士。要有意识地去克制这种憎恶感——厌恶杰出人物是最可耻的，就像赞同大人物能让我们崇高一样，厌恶伟人也贬低了我们自己。
46．Master your antipathies
Master your antipathies. We often allow ourselves to take dislikes, and that before we know anything of a person. At times this innate yet vulgar aversion attaches itself to eminent people. Good sense masters this feeling, for there is nothing more discreditable than to dislike those better than ourselves. As sympathy with great men ennobles us, so dislike to them degrades us.

[book_title]47．避免“为荣誉而决斗”
避免“为荣誉而决斗”，这是审慎行事的最主要的一点。那些雄才大略之人总是远离极端，以确保不偏不倚。从一个极端到另一个极端，有很长的一段路，谨慎之人经常采取中庸之道，所以能够从容应对。避免招惹是非比招惹是非后再全身而退要容易一些。危险考验我们的判断力，最好避开，而不是征服。有时，一个事端能够引发更大的事端，以致可能带来耻辱。因自身秉性或种族关系，有的人容易陷入事端之中。而那些理智行事的人，对这类事总会思虑再三。征服危险并非强者，善于避险才是真正的勇士。当有傻瓜准备冒险时，你就要找借口，避免成为第二个傻瓜。
47．Avoid "affairs of honour"
Avoid "affairs of honour"－one of the chiefest aims of prudence. In men of great ability the extremes are kept far asunder, so that there is a long distance between them, and they always keep in the middle of their caution, so that they take time to break through it. It is easier to avoid such affairs than to come well out of them. They test our judgment; it is better to avoid them than to conquer in them. One affair of honour leads to another, and may lead to an affair of dishonour. There are men so constituted by nature or by nation that they easily enter upon such obligations. But for him who walks by the light of reason, such a matter requires long thinking over. There is more valour needed not to take up the affair than to conquer in it. When there is one fool ready for the occasion, one may excuse oneself from being the second.

[book_title]48．做一个有深度的人至关重要
做一个有深度的人至关重要。一个人的内涵至少与外表一样重要。有人只是空有一具好皮囊，就像一间房子，因资金不足而只装饰了表面，门廊像宫殿，而里屋却如茅草房。深入到他们的头脑之中，你将一无所获。尽管他们会来打扰你，在最初的寒暄过后，他们就无话可说了。与人初次见面，他们的寒暄敏捷如西西里的骏马，不过随即便陷入沉默。因为，没有思想的源泉，言语会很快枯竭。浅薄之人可能会被这种人蒙蔽，但是，明智之人能够一眼看透，知道他们的内心空无一物，除了一些可作笑柄的材料。
48．So much depends on being a person of depth
So much depends on being a person of depth. The interior must be at least as much as the exterior. There are natures all frontage, like houses that for want of means have the portico of a palace leading to the rooms of a cottage. It is no use boring into such persons, although they bore you, for conversation flags after the first salutation. They prance through the first compliments like Sicilian stallions, but silence soon succeeds, for the flow of words soon ceases where there is no spring of thoughts. Others may be taken in by them because they themselves have but a view of the surface, but not the prudent, who look within them and find nothing there except material for scorn.

[book_title]49．明察善断
明察善断。一个明察善断的人可以驾驭事物，而不被事物驾驭。他能迅速探知事物最本质的东西，他还善于相面。无论是谁，只要他看一眼，就能判断是什么样的人，并断定其本性。通过有限的观察，他能探知隐藏最深的秘密。他洞察敏锐，领会精微，推理明确，可以发现、留意、掌握和了解一切事物。
49．Observation and judgment
Observation and judgment. A man with these rules things, not they him. He sounds at once the profoundest depths; he is a phrenologist by means of physiognomy. On seeing a person he understands him and judges of his inmost nature. From a few observations he deciphers what is most hidden. Keen observation, subtile insight, judicious inference: with these he discovers, notices, grasps, and comprehends everything.

[book_title]50．不失自尊
不失自尊，也不要太过随便。要让自身的正义感成为令你正直的真正标准，使你对自己的审查比外界的一切制裁更为严格。任何不体面之事都别做，并非害怕外界的权威，而是因为自尊。注重这一点，就不需要塞涅卡所谓的“假想监督者”(1)了。
50．Never lose self-respect
Never lose self-respect, or be too familiar with oneself. Let your own right feeling be the true standard of your rectitude, and owe more to the strictness of your own self-judgment than to all external sanctions. Leave off anything unseemly more from regard for your own self-respect than from fear of external authority. Pay regard to that and there is no need of Seneca's imaginary tutor.
(1) 指良心，出自塞涅卡《道德书简》。

[book_title]51．选择有道
选择有道。生活中的许多事都要看你是否有选择能力。只靠智慧或学习能力是不够的，你需要有良好的品味和正确的判断力。若想成为精英，必须精于选择。这就需要你做到两件事：有能力选择和能够作出最佳选择。许多人头脑聪敏，有敏锐的判断力，且博学多闻，可是面临选择时仍是不知所措。他们总是挑选最糟糕的东西，好像要故意犯错。所以，懂得如何选择是最伟大的天赋之一。
51．Know how to choose well
Know how to choose well. Most of life depends thereon. It needs good taste and correct judgment, for which neither intellect nor study suffices. To be choice, you must choose, and for this two things are needed: to be able to choose at all, and then to choose the best. There are many men of fecund and subtle mind, of keen judgment, of much learning, and of great observation who yet are at a loss when they come to choose. They always take the worst as if they had tried to go wrong. Thus this is one of the greatest gifts from above.

[book_title]52．从不慌乱
从不慌乱。绝不让自己窘迫是审慎之人的一大目标。这也是一个有着一颗高贵的心的真正的人的标志，因为只有胸怀宽阔的人才不易情绪失衡。激情乃是内心的玩笑，任何过度的激情都会削弱我们的谨慎。假如你任其流露，将有损你的名声。因此，让我们主宰自己，无论是一帆风顺还是举步维艰，都不因任何事情失去自控而损害名声。相反，要表现得泰然自若而增进我们的名声。
52．Never be put out
Never be put out. It is a great aim of prudence never to be embarrassed. It is the sign of a real man. of a noble heart, for magnanimity is not easily put off ballance. The passions are the humors of the soul, and every excess in them weakens prudence. If they overflow through the mouth, the reputation will be in danger. Let us therefore be so much and so great a master over ourselves that neither in the most fortunate nor in the most adverse circumstances can anything cause our reputation injury by disturbing our self-possession, but rather enhance it by showing his superiority.

[book_title]53．聪明且勤奋
聪明且勤奋。勤奋可加快实现你反复考虑过的计划。蠢人常因匆忙而失败，他们无法掌握要领，行事缺乏准备。而智者则不然，他们常因拖延而失败，他们深谋远虑，再三斟酌，这种耽搁往往让他们无法及时作出正确判断。但是，做事敏捷就是好运之母。讲求效率，事不隔夜，可成就良多。“忙里偷闲，缓中带急”，确是金玉良言。
53．Be diligent and intelligent
Be diligent and intelligent. Diligence promptly executes what intelligence slowly excogitates. Hurry is the failing of fools: they know not the crucial point and set to work without preparation. On the other hand, the wise more often fail from procrastination: foresight begets deliberation, and delay often nullifies prompt judgment. Celerity is the mother of good fortune. He has done much who leaves nothing over till tomorrow. "Make haste slowly" is a royal motto.

[book_title]54．懂得展示你的勇气
懂得展示你的勇气。即便是兔子也敢拔死狮的鬃毛。勇气不是开玩笑的。只要为之屈服一次，就会有第二次，无止境地屈服下去。最终达到目的所承受的麻烦不会比最初少。精神上的勇气总是胜过体力上的蛮勇。勇气应该像利剑一般，待命于谨慎之鞘中，伺机而出。同时，它也是你保护自身重要部位的盾牌。精神上的软弱比身体上的虚弱更把人贬低。很多人资质非凡，就因为没有这种刚毅的心，从而死气沉沉地枉过一生，在萎靡中死去。奇妙的大自然自有其绝妙的安排：在蜜蜂身上结合了甘甜的蜂蜜和尖锐的毒刺。
54．Know how to show your teeth
Know how to show your teeth. Even hares can pull the mane of a dead lion. There is no joke about courage. Give way to the first and you must yield to the second, and so on till the last, and to gain your point at last costs as much trouble as would have gained much more at first. Moral courage exceeds physical; it should be like a sword kept ready for use in the scabbard of caution. It Is the shield of great place; moral cowardice lowers one more than physical. Many have had eminent qualities, yet, for want of a stout heart, they passed inanimate lives and found a tomb in their own sloth. Wise Nature has thoughtfully combined in the bee the sweetness of its honey with the sharpness of its sting.

[book_title]55．善于等待
善于等待。善于等待的人从不慌张，从不受控于自身情绪，有着一颗有耐心的高贵之心。人若想去管别人，首先要管好自己。在到达机会的核心之前，你得经过其外围。明智的犹疑使目标更有趣味，使手段更加成熟。时间老人的拐杖比赫克乐斯(1)的铁杖还好使。上帝惩戒人，
